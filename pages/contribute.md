# Contributing to Kotlin

Kotlin is an Apache 2 OSS Project. The source code, tooling, documentation and even this web site is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin). 
While Kotlin is mostly developed by JetBrains, there are hundreds of external contributors to the Kotlin project, and we always look for more people&mdash;[become one of them](https://kotlinlang.org/community). 

## Participate in Early Access Preview

You can help us improve Kotlin if you participate in Kotlin Early Access Preview (EAP) and provide your valuable feedback.
 
For every release, Kotlin ships a few preview builds where you can try out the latest features before they go to production. You can report found bugs in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue) 
and we will try to fix them in the next EAP build. This way, you can get bug fixes earlier than the standard Kotlin release cycle.

## Contribute to the compiler, standard library, and tooling

If you want to contribute to the Kotlin compiler, standard library, or tooling, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin), check out the latest Kotlin version,
 and follow the [instructions on how to contribute to the code](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/docs/contributing.md).
 
You can help us by completing [open tasks](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT?q=tag:%20%7BUp%20For%20Grabs%7D%20and%20State:%20Open). 
Please stay in touch with us because we may have questions and comments on your changes. Otherwise, we won't be able to incorporate them. 

## Contribute to other libraries and create your own

Kotlin ships with the standard library providing core capabilities and a number of additional (kotlinx) libraries that extend its functionality. 
Each kotlinx library is developed in a separate repo, has its own versioning and release cycle. 

If you want to contribute to the standard library, follow [the standard process for contributing](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/docs/contributing.md).

If you want to contribute to a kotlinx library, follow the contribution process described for each library, such as [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines),
 [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you have a library that could be useful for others, let us know.

## Contribute to the documentation

If you have helpful information for [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) or have found a documentation issue, 
feel free to check out [the documentation source code on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site/tree/master/pages/docs)
and send us a Pull Request. Please stay in touch with us because we may have questions and comments on your changes. Otherwise, we won't be able to incorporate them. 

The documentation site is built using Markdown and Jekyll. 

## Create tutorials or videos

If you've created tutorials or videos for Kotlin, please share them with us. We would be happy to add them to [Awesome Kotlin](https://kotlin.link/) maintained by the community.

## Translate documentation to other languages

You are welcome to translate the Kotlin documentation into your own language and publish your translation on your web site.
However, we won't be able to host your translation in the main repository and publish it on [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).

This site is the official documentation for the language, and we ensure that all the information here
is correct and up to date. Unfortunately, we won't be able to review documentation in other languages. 

## Hold events and presentations

If you've given or just plan to give presentations or hold events on Kotlin, let us know. We'll feature them on [the event list](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/events.html)
