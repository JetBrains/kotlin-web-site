# Contributing to Kotlin

Kotlin is an Apache 2 OSS Project. The source code, tooling, documentation and even this web site is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin). While Kotlin is mostly developed by JetBrains, there are hundreds of external contributors to the Kotlin project, and we always look for more people&mdash;become one of them. 

## Contribute to the code

If you want to contribute to the Kotlin code, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin), check out the latest Kotlin version,
 and follow the [instructions on how to contribute to the code](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/docs/contributing.md).
You can complete [open tasks](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT?q=tag:%20%7BUp%20For%20Grabs%7D%20and%20State:%20Open) or suggest an improvement using the [Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process (KEEP)](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP).

### Contribute to existing libraries and create your own

Kotlin ships with a very small runtime, and we plan to keep it that way. As a contributor, you can develop functionality missing in the standard runtime library under the Kotlin-X umbrella or as an individual project. 
If you want to contribute to any existing library, check it out. If you have a library that could be useful for others, let us know.

## Contribute to the documentation

If you have helpful information for [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) or have found a documentation issue, feel free to check out [the documentation source code on GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin-web-site),
commit changes, and send us a Pull Request. Please stay in touch because we may have questions and comments on your changes. Otherwise, we won't be able to incorporate them. 

If you want to propose changes to a specific page, you can click **Edit Page** right on the page.
  
The documentation site is built using Markdown and Jekyll. 

## Create tutorials or videos

If you've created tutorials or videos for Kotlin, please share them with us. We would be happy to add them to [Awesome Kotlin](https://kotlin.link/) maintained by the community.

## Translate documentation to other languages

You are welcome to translate the Kotlin documentation into your own language and publish your translation on your web site.
However, we won't be able to host your translation in the main repository and publish it on [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).

This site is the official documentation for the language, and we ensure that all the information here
is correct and up to date. Unfortunately, we won't able to review documentation in your own language. 

## Hold events and presentations

If you've given or just plan to give presentations or hold events on Kotlin, let us know. We'll feature them on [the event list](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/events.html)

##Participate in Early Access Preview
You can help us improve Kotlin if you participate in Kotlin Early Access Preview (EAP) and provide your valuable feedback. 
For every release, Kotlin ships a few preview builds where you can try out the latest features before they go to production. Please file found issues and enhancement requests in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).
