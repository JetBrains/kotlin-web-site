# Why Teach Kotlin

### The Language of Android ###
Revamp your course with the first-choice language for [Android development](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/android-overview.html). Kotlin has natively supported the mobile development workflow and associated tools since 2017.

> Decrease in boilerplate helps us to quickly identify which fundamental Android concepts students are missing. The likelihood of issues arising due to some basic syntactic/language problems is lower, allowing students instead to focus on more fundamental software design matters.

### Easy to teach fundamental concepts ###

Kotlin's industrial popularity has a sound educational foundation. It is a full-featured language that supports teaching various computer science and software engineering topics like algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, machine learning, compilers, databases, and more.
Kotlin builds on the students' previous programming experience and is simple to grasp for those with a Java or Python background. 

> I think our students benefit in general from being exposed to a wide range of programming languages, and I think it is valuable for them to gain experience in using more modern languages alongside the more traditional ones like Java and C++.

> Nick Efford, University of Leeds

> I appreciate Kotlin's diffusion, its innovation while being able to ‘stay in the mainstream’ to soften the learning curve, the way it supports key concepts – in short, its clarity and cleanness. 
> {:.kto-quote__text}
> Enrico Denti, University of Bologna

Kotlin has a soft learning curve and makes it easy to migrate existing course materials.

> Kotlin is as easy to use as Java, but it has pretty much the same desirable language features of harder languages such as C++. 
> {:.kto-quote__text}
> Nicola Capodieci, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia
> {:.kto-quote__author}
{:.kto-quote}

> My students think Kotlin is an easy language to learn. Some students have adopted Kotlin as their main programming language. They use it as their language of choice when they can choose a language for completing an assignment or project.

### Student motivation ### 
Knowing that Kotlin is a marketable skill, students tend to be more enthusiastic in studying it. Another big motivator for students is learning a language that allows them to quickly see results from their code.

> Nearly all my students have picked up Kotlin quite easily and really loved it, as compared with Java. 
> {:.kto-quote__text}
> Scott Stanchfield, Johns Hopkins University
> {:.kto-quote__author}
{:.kto-quote}

> Students like the language. It's less verbose than Java, for instance, and has more market appeal than OCaml and ML. 
> {:.kto-quote__text}
> Fernando Magno Quintão Pereira, Federal University of Minas Gerais
> {:.kto-quote__author}
{:.kto-quote}

88% of students give positive feedback about learning Kotlin.

### Interoperable ###
Seamless interoperability with the JVM ecosystem means that Kotlin can rely on numerous existing libraries. Our handy Java-to-Kotlin converter provides excellent support to migrate Java code to Kotlin and helps students quickly learn the syntax if they are already familiar with Java. Java programs can call Kotlin code without any overhead either. Kotlin can also be compiled to JavaScript to run in the browser or on Node.js, or into a standalone native binary targeting any major operating system.

> Kotlin is faster to develop and comprehend what is happening; near 100% backwards compatibility makes it easy to show in Java and translate into Kotlin while still utilizing every available library from Java; Students seem to understand it fairly quickly.

> For the upcoming Introductory Programming course, we chose Kotlin, because we wanted a language that targets the JVM and seamlessly interoperates with its ecosystem: a stack of utmost importance to our market.

### Supports multiple paradigms ###

Kotlin combines the major programming paradigms in an elegant way, making it possible to use functional, imperative, object-oriented, or procedural programming – all within the same language. With Kotlin’s support for coroutines, the concepts of concurrency and parallelism come naturally.

> You are able to teach procedural programming for the very beginners without needing to describe classes. Thus, your course can be more consistent.

### Supports coding safety ###
Kotlin promotes writing correct programs with static type checking and automatic memory management. It rules out null-pointer dereferences and has no explicit pointers or undetectable uninitialized variables.

### Modern and concise language design ###
Kotlin's syntactic simplicity makes it beginner-friendly, while at the same time, it offers sophisticated features that ambitious students won't grow out of.

Kotlin allows students to focus on expressing their ideas and write less boilerplate code. Less code written also means less code to test and debug. Such language design makes Kotlin a highly productive language, and it also simplifies grading homework and understanding your students' code.

> Simple syntax. Less code to get more done. At the same time Kotlin has advanced topics such as coroutines.

Instructors love Kotlin’s concise and expressive syntax. Source: internal Teaching Kotlin Study.

> Kotlin's compactness is my favorite feature. I’ve translated a few of my Java programming courseworks into Kotlin and noticed that code typically shrinks to 50% of its original size. As a teacher, I also get some benefit from being able to use less code when showing students how to do things.

### Prepares students for careers ###
Teaching professional software engineering practices improves students’ employment prospects. In-class coding projects are typically fully functional Android applications, and real-world assignments are more engaging for students than abstract examples are.

### Tooling and learning materials ###
The top tools of the profession are packaged with the language. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate supports Kotlin as a first-class citizen and is free for educators and students. It offers great productivity features, such as smart code completion, code inspections, a visual debugger, and more.

The educational EduTools plugin is also available to help learn and teach Kotlin programming. Educators can use existing interactive courses or create custom ones, with hands-on assignments and practice coding tasks. Integrated tests will automatically check the assignments and provide feedback.
