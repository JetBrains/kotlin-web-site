Kotlin does not have Python's _resource managers_ or Java's _try-with-resources_, but thanks to extension functions, there's `use`:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
File("/home/aasmund/test.txt").inputStream().use {
     val bytes = it.readBytes()
     println(bytes.size)
}
```
</div>



`use` can be invoked on anything that implements the `Closeable` interface, and when the `use` block ends (whether normally or due to an exception), `close()` will be called on the object upon which you invoked `use`. If an exception is raised within the block or by `close()`, it will bubble out of `use`. If both the block and `close()` raise, it's the exception from the block that will bubble out.

Thus, you can create something resource manager-like by creating a class that implements `Closeable`, does its setup work in `init`, and does its cleanup work in `close()`.

In case you're wondering about how `use`, which is a function, can just be followed by a block like that, see the section on [DSL support](functional-programming.html#receivers).
