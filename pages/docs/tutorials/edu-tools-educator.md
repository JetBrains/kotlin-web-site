With the [EduTools plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools), available both in 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you can teach Kotlin through code practicing tasks.
Take a look at the [Educator Start Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/educator-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin)
to learn how to create a simple Kotlin course that includes a set of programming tasks and integrated tests.
