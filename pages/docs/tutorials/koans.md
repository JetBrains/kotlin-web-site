Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax.
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass.
You can play with [Koans online](http://try.kotlinlang.org/koans) or offline by cloning the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans):

1. Download the Koans by cloning the project from GitHub

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans
    ```

2. Open up the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite editor. Note: If IntelliJ IDEA prompts you to update the Kotlin library, just click yes. 

3. Run a test. Make it pass

4. Repeat for all tests!


The repository has two branches, *master* which contains the exercises for you to do and *resolutions* which contains the resolved exercises. Make sure you don't cheat!
