Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax.
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass.
You can work with Kotlin Koans in one of three ways.

1. You can play with [Koans online](http://try.kotlinlang.org/koans).

2. You can solve the tasks right inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio by [installing the EduTools plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html) and [choosing Kotlin Koans course](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans).

3. You can clone the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans).
You can open this project in IntelliJ IDEA, or work with it from the command line using your favourite editor. 
Note that to work with Koans from Android Studio, use the EduTools plugin.

Whatever way you choose to solve koans, you can see the solution for each task. In the online version and inside EduTools plugin you'll find the button "Show answer". The GitHub repository has two branches, *master* which contains the exercises for you to do and *resolutions* which contains the resolved exercises. We recommend checking the solution after you implement the task to compare your solution with the proposed one. Make sure you don't cheat!
