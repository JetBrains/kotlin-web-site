With the [EduTools plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools), available both in 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you can learn Kotlin through code practicing tasks.

Take a look at the [Learner Start Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans),
which will get you started with the Kotlin Koans course inside IntelliJ IDEA.
Solve interactive coding challenges and get instant feedback right inside the IDE.
