title:  "Getting Started with Kotlin"
---

It’s easy to get started with Kotlin using the Kotlin plugin integrated in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). 
Benefit from code highlighting, code completion, refactoring, debugging, and other features available for Kotlin.

If you want to **start from scratch**, you can [create a basic Kotlin application](jvm-get-started.html). 
Once you’ve created the application, you can dive deeper into Kotlin syntax:

*   Add sample code from [Kotlin examples](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview) 
*   Install the [EduTools plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) for IDEA and complete exercises 
from the [Kotlin Koans course](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans)

If you already **have a Java project**, you can:

*   **[Start adding Kotlin code to your project](mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html).**  
Begin with a small class or function with the annotations required for proper [interoperability with Java code](../reference/java-interop.html).
*   **Write some tests in Kotlin** for your code.  
Tests are a safe place to add Kotlin to the codebase because they are not bundled with your application during packaging.
*   **[Convert Java code to Kotlin](mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html#converting-an-existing-java-file-to-kotlin-with-j2k)**.  
Extract small pieces of Java functionality and convert to Kotlin classes and functions using the Java-to-Kotlin converter.
