# Reference

Provides a complete reference to the Kotlin language and the [standard library](/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/index.html).

### Where to Begin

This reference is designed for you to easily learn Kotlin in a matter of hours.
Start with the [basic syntax](basic-syntax.html), then proceed to more advanced topics.
While reading, you can try out the examples in the [online IDE](http://try.kotlinlang.org/).

Once you get an idea of what Kotlin looks like, try yourself in solving some [Kotlin Koans](/docs/tutorials/koans.html) - interactive programming exercises.
If you are not sure how to solve a Koan, or you're looking for a more elegant solution, check out [Kotlin idioms](idioms.html).


### Browse offline
You can download the entire reference documentation as a single [PDF file]({{ site.pdf_url }}).
