# Basic Types

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some of the types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes. 
In this section we describe the basic types used in Kotlin: numbers, characters, booleans, arrays, and strings.

## Numbers

Kotlin handles numbers in a way close to Java, but not exactly the same. For example, there are no implicit widening conversions for numbers, and literals are slightly different in some cases.

Kotlin provides the following built-in types representing numbers (this is close to Java):

| Type	 | Bit width|
|--------|----------|
| Double | 64       |
| Float	 | 32       |
| Long	 | 64       |
| Int	 | 32       |
| Short	 | 16       |
| Byte	 | 8        |

Note that characters are not numbers in Kotlin.

### Literal Constants

There are the following kinds of literal constants for integral values:

* Decimals: `123`
  * Longs are tagged by a capital `L`: `123L`
* Hexadecimals: `0x0F`
* Binaries: `0b00001011`

NOTE: Octal literals are not supported.

Kotlin also supports a conventional notation for floating-point numbers:
 
* Doubles by default: `123.5`, `123.5e10`
* Floats are tagged by `f` or `F`: `123.5f`
 
### Underscores in numeric literals (since 1.1)
 
You can use underscores to make number constants more readable:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val oneMillion = 1_000_000
val creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L
val socialSecurityNumber = 999_99_9999L
val hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E
val bytes = 0b11010010_01101001_10010100_10010010
```

</div>

### Representation

On the Java platform, numbers are physically stored as JVM primitive types, unless we need a nullable number reference (e.g. `Int?`) or generics are involved. 
In the latter cases numbers are boxed.

Note that boxing of numbers does not necessarily preserve identity:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val a: Int = 10000
    println(a === a) // Prints 'true'
    val boxedA: Int? = a
    val anotherBoxedA: Int? = a
    println(boxedA === anotherBoxedA) // !!!Prints 'false'!!!
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

On the other hand, it preserves equality:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val a: Int = 10000
    println(a == a) // Prints 'true'
    val boxedA: Int? = a
    val anotherBoxedA: Int? = a
    println(boxedA == anotherBoxedA) // Prints 'true'
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

### Explicit Conversions

Due to different representations, smaller types are not subtypes of bigger ones.
If they were, we would have troubles of the following sort:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
// Hypothetical code, does not actually compile:
val a: Int? = 1 // A boxed Int (java.lang.Integer)
val b: Long? = a // implicit conversion yields a boxed Long (java.lang.Long)
print(b == a) // Surprise! This prints "false" as Long's equals() checks whether the other is Long as well
```

</div>

So equality would have been lost silently all over the place, not to mention identity.

As a consequence, smaller types are NOT implicitly converted to bigger types.
This means that we cannot assign a value of type `Byte` to an `Int` variable without an explicit conversion

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val b: Byte = 1 // OK, literals are checked statically
    val i: Int = b // ERROR
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

We can use explicit conversions to widen numbers

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val b: Byte = 1
//sampleStart
    val i: Int = b.toInt() // OK: explicitly widened
    print(i)
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

Every number type supports the following conversions:

* `toByte(): Byte`
* `toShort(): Short`
* `toInt(): Int`
* `toLong(): Long`
* `toFloat(): Float`
* `toDouble(): Double`
* `toChar(): Char`

Absence of implicit conversions is rarely noticeable because the type is inferred from the context, and arithmetical operations are overloaded for appropriate conversions, for example

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val l = 1L + 3 // Long + Int => Long
```

</div>

### Operations

Kotlin supports the standard set of arithmetical operations over numbers, which are declared as members of appropriate classes (but the compiler optimizes the calls down to the corresponding instructions).
See [Operator overloading](operator-overloading.html).

As of bitwise operations, there're no special characters for them, but just named functions that can be called in infix form, for example:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val x = (1 shl 2) and 0x000FF000
```

</div>

Here is the complete list of bitwise operations (available for `Int` and `Long` only):

* `shl(bits)` – signed shift left (Java's `<<`)
* `shr(bits)` – signed shift right (Java's `>>`)
* `ushr(bits)` – unsigned shift right (Java's `>>>`)
* `and(bits)` – bitwise and
* `or(bits)` – bitwise or
* `xor(bits)` – bitwise xor
* `inv()` – bitwise inversion

### Floating Point Numbers Comparison

The operations on floating point numbers discussed in this section are:

* Equality checks: `a == b` and `a != b`
* Comparison operators: `a < b`, `a > b`, `a <= b`, `a >= b`
* Range instantiation and range checks: `a..b`, `x in a..b`, `x !in a..b`

When the operands `a` and `b` are statically known to be `Float` or `Double` or their nullable counterparts (the type is 
declared or inferred or is a result of a [smart cast](typecasts.html#smart-casts)), the operations on the 
numbers and the range that they form follow the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic. 

However, to support generic use cases and provide total ordering, when the operands are **not** statically typed as 
floating point numbers (e.g. `Any`, `Comparable<...>`, a type parameter), the operations use the 
`equals` and `compareTo` implementations for `Float` and `Double`, which disagree with the standard, so that:

* `NaN` is considered equal to itself
* `NaN` is considered greater than any other element including `POSITIVE_INFINITY`
* `-0.0` is considered less than `0.0`

## Characters

Characters are represented by the type `Char`. They can not be treated directly as numbers

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
fun check(c: Char) {
    if (c == 1) { // ERROR: incompatible types
        // ...
    }
}
```

</div>

Character literals go in single quotes: `'1'`.
Special characters can be escaped using a backslash.
The following escape sequences are supported: `\t`, `\b`, `\n`, `\r`, `\'`, `\"`, `\\` and `\$`.
To encode any other character, use the Unicode escape sequence syntax: `'\uFF00'`.

We can explicitly convert a character to an `Int` number:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
fun decimalDigitValue(c: Char): Int {
    if (c !in '0'..'9')
        throw IllegalArgumentException("Out of range")
    return c.toInt() - '0'.toInt() // Explicit conversions to numbers
}
```

</div>

Like numbers, characters are boxed when a nullable reference is needed. Identity is not preserved by the boxing operation.

## Booleans

The type `Boolean` represents booleans, and has two values: *true*{: .keyword } and *false*{: .keyword }.

Booleans are boxed if a nullable reference is needed.

Built-in operations on booleans include

* `||` – lazy disjunction
* `&&` – lazy conjunction
* `!` - negation

## Arrays

Arrays in Kotlin are represented by the `Array` class, that has `get` and `set` functions (that turn into `[]` by operator overloading conventions), and `size` property, along with a few other useful member functions:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
class Array<T> private constructor() {
    val size: Int
    operator fun get(index: Int): T
    operator fun set(index: Int, value: T): Unit

    operator fun iterator(): Iterator<T>
    // ...
}
```

</div>

To create an array, we can use a library function `arrayOf()` and pass the item values to it, so that `arrayOf(1, 2, 3)` creates an array `[1, 2, 3]`.
Alternatively, the `arrayOfNulls()` library function can be used to create an array of a given size filled with null elements.

Another option is to use the `Array` constructor that takes the array size and the function that can return the initial value
of each array element given its index:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Creates an Array<String> with values ["0", "1", "4", "9", "16"]
    val asc = Array(5) { i -> (i * i).toString() }
    asc.forEach { println(it) }
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

As we said above, the `[]` operation stands for calls to member functions `get()` and `set()`.

Note: unlike Java, arrays in Kotlin are invariant. This means that Kotlin does not let us assign an `Array<String>`
to an `Array<Any>`, which prevents a possible runtime failure (but you can use `Array<out Any>`, 
see [Type Projections](generics.html#type-projections)).

Kotlin also has specialized classes to represent arrays of primitive types without boxing overhead: `ByteArray`,
`ShortArray`, `IntArray` and so on. These classes have no inheritance relation to the `Array` class, but they
have the same set of methods and properties. Each of them also has a corresponding factory function:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val x: IntArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3)
x[0] = x[1] + x[2]
```

</div>

## Unsigned integers

> Unsigned types are available only since Kotlin 1.3 and currently are *experimental*. See details [below](#experimental-status-of-unsigned-integers) 
{:.note}

Kotlin introduces following types for unsigned integers:

* `kotlin.UByte`: an unsigned 8-bit integer, ranges from 0 to 255
* `kotlin.UShort`: an unsigned 16-bit integer, ranges from 0 to 65535
* `kotlin.UInt`: an unsigned 32-bit integer, ranges from 0 to 2^32 - 1
* `kotlin.ULong`: an unsigned 64-bit integer, ranges from 0 to 2^64 - 1

Unsigned types support most of the operations of their signed counterparts.

> Note that changing type from unsigned type to signed counterpart (and vice versa) is a *binary incompatible* change
{:.note}

Unsigned types are implemented using another experimental feature, namely [inline classes](inline-classes.html).

### Specialized classes 

Same as for primitives, each of unsigned type has corresponding type that represents array, specialized for that unsigned type:

* `kotlin.UByteArray`: an array of unsigned bytes
* `kotlin.UShortArray`: an array of unsigned shorts
* `kotlin.UIntArray`: an array of unsigned ints
* `kotlin.ULongArray`: an array of unsigned longs

Same as for signed integer arrays, they provide similar API to `Array` class without boxing overhead. 

Also, [ranges and progressions](ranges.html) supported for `UInt` and `ULong` by classes `kotlin.ranges.UIntRange`, `kotlin.ranges.UIntProgression`, `kotlin.ranges.ULongRange`, `kotlin.ranges.ULongProgression` 

### Literals

To make unsigned integers easier to use, Kotlin provides an ability to tag an integer literal with a suffix indicating a specific unsigned type (similarly to Float/Long):
* suffixes `u` and `U` tag literal as unsigned. Exact type will be determined based on the expected type. If no expected type is provided, `UInt` or `ULong` will be chosen based on the size of literal 

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val b: UByte = 1u  // UByte, expected type provided
val s: UShort = 1u // UShort, expected type provided
val l: ULong = 1u  // ULong, expected type provided

val a1 = 42u // UInt: no expected type provided, constant fits in UInt
val a2 = 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFFu // ULong: no expected type provided, constant doesn't fit in UInt
```

</div> 

* suffixes `uL` and `UL` explicitly tag literal as unsigned long.

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val a = 1UL // ULong, even though no expected type provided and constant fits into UInt
```

</div>

### Experimental status of unsigned integers

The design of unsigned types is experimental, meaning that this feature is moving fast and no compatibility guarantees are given. When using unsigned arithmetics in Kotlin 1.3+, warning will be reported, indicating that this feature is experimental. To remove warning, you have to opt-in for experimental usage of unsigned types. 

There are two possible ways to opt-in for unsigned types: with marking your API as experimental too, or without doing that.

- to propagate experimentality, either annotate declarations which use unsigned integers with `@ExperimentalUnsignedTypes` or pass `-Xexperimental=kotlin.ExperimentalUnsignedTypes` to the compiler (note that the latter will make *all* declaration in compiled module experimental)
- to opt-in without propagating experimentality, either annotate declarations with `@UseExperimental(ExperimentalUnsignedTypes::class)` or pass `-Xuse-experimental=kotlin.ExperimentalUnsignedTypes`

It's up to you to decide if your clients have to explicitly opt-in into usage of your API, but bear in mind that unsigned types are an experimental feature, so API which uses them can be suddenly broken due to changes in language. 

See also or Experimental API [KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/experimental.md) for technical details.

### Further discussion

See [language proposal for unsigned types](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/unsigned-types.md) for technical details and further discussion.

## Strings

Strings are represented by the type `String`. Strings are immutable.
Elements of a string are characters that can be accessed by the indexing operation: `s[i]`.
A string can be iterated over with a *for*{: .keyword }-loop:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
val str = "abcd"
//sampleStart
for (c in str) {
    println(c)
}
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator. This also works for concatenating strings with values of other types, as long
as the first element in the expression is a string:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
val s = "abc" + 1
println(s + "def")
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

Note that in most cases using [string templates](#string-templates) or raw strings is preferable to string concatenation.

### String Literals

Kotlin has two types of string literals: escaped strings that may have escaped characters in them and raw strings that can contain newlines and arbitrary text. An escaped string is very much like a Java string:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val s = "Hello, world!\n"
```

</div>

Escaping is done in the conventional way, with a backslash. See [Characters](#characters) above for the list of supported escape sequences.

A raw string is delimited by a triple quote (`"""`), contains no escaping and can contain newlines and any other characters:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val text = """
    for (c in "foo")
        print(c)
"""
```

</div>

You can remove leading whitespace with [`trimMargin()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/trim-margin.html) function:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val text = """
    |Tell me and I forget.
    |Teach me and I remember.
    |Involve me and I learn.
    |(Benjamin Franklin)
    """.trimMargin()
```

</div>

By default `|` is used as margin prefix, but you can choose another character and pass it as a parameter, like `trimMargin(">")`.

### String Templates

Strings may contain template expressions, i.e. pieces of code that are evaluated and whose results are concatenated into the string.
A template expression starts with a dollar sign ($) and consists of either a simple name:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val i = 10
    println("i = $i") // prints "i = 10"
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

or an arbitrary expression in curly braces:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val s = "abc"
    println("$s.length is ${s.length}") // prints "abc.length is 3"
//sampleEnd
}
```

</div>

Templates are supported both inside raw strings and inside escaped strings.
If you need to represent a literal `$` character in a raw string (which doesn't support backslash escaping), you can use the following syntax:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
val price = """
${'$'}9.99
"""
```

</div>
