# Basic Types

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable. Some types are built-in, because their implementation is optimized, but to the user they look like ordinary classes. In this section we describe most of these types: numbers, characters, booleans and arrays.

## Numbers

Kotlin handles numbers in a way close to Java, but not exactly the same. For example, there are no implicit widening conversions for numbers, and literals are slightly different in some cases.

Kotlin provides the following built-in types representing numbers (this is close to Java):

| Type	 | Bit width|
|--------|----------|
| Double | 64       |
| Float	 | 32       |
| Long	 | 64       |
| Int	 | 32       |
| Short	 | 16       |
| Byte	 | 8        |

Note that characters are not numbers in Kotlin.

### Literal Constants

There are the following kinds of literal constants for integral values:

* Decimals: `123`
  * Longs are tagged by a capital `L`: `123L`
* Hexadecimals: `0x0F`
* Binaries: `0b00001011`

NOTE: Octal literals are not supported.

Kotlin also supports a conventional notation for floating-point numbers:
 
* Doubles by default: `123.5`, `123.5e10`
* Floats are tagged by `f` or `F`: `123.5f` 

### Representation

On the Java platform, numbers are physically stored as JVM primitive types, unless we need a nullable number reference (e.g. `Int?`) or generics are involved. 
In the latter cases numbers are boxed.

Note that boxing of numbers does not preserve identity:

``` kotlin
val a: Int = 10000
print(a === a) // Prints 'true'
val boxedA: Int? = a
val anotherBoxedA: Int? = a
print(boxedA === anotherBoxedA) // !!!Prints 'false'!!!
```

On the other hand, it preserves equality:

``` kotlin
val a: Int = 10000
print(a == a) // Prints 'true'
val boxedA: Int? = a
val anotherBoxedA: Int? = a
print(boxedA == anotherBoxedA) // Prints 'true'
```

### Explicit Conversions

Due to different representations, smaller types are not subtypes of bigger ones.
If they were, we would have troubles of the following sort:

``` kotlin
// Hypothetical code, does not actually compile:
val a: Int? = 1 // A boxed Int (java.lang.Integer)
val b: Long? = a // implicit conversion yields a boxed Long (java.lang.Long)
print(a == b) // Surprise! This prints "false" as Long's equals() check for other part to be Long as well
```

So not only identity, but even equality would have been lost silently all over the place.

As a consequence, smaller types are NOT implicitly converted to bigger types.
This means that we cannot assign a value of type `Byte` to an `Int` variable without an explicit conversion

``` kotlin
val b: Byte = 1 // OK, literals are checked statically
val i: Int = b // ERROR
```

We can use explicit conversions to widen numbers

``` kotlin
val i: Int = b.toInt() // OK: explicitly widened
```

Every number type supports the following conversions:

* `toByte(): Byte`
* `toShort(): Short`
* `toInt(): Int`
* `toLong(): Long`
* `toFloat(): Float`
* `toDouble(): Double`
* `toChar(): Char`

Absence of implicit conversions is rarely noticeable because the type is inferred from the context, and arithmetical operations are overloaded for appropriate conversions, for example

``` kotlin
val l = 1L + 3 // Long + Int => Long
```

### Operations

Kotlin supports the standard set of arithmetical operations over numbers, which are declared as members of appropriate classes (but the compiler optimizes the calls down to the corresponding instructions).
See [Operator overloading](operator-overloading.html).

As of bitwise operations, there're no special characters for them, but just named functions that can be called in infix form, for example:

``` kotlin
val x = (1 shl 2) and 0x000FF000
```

Here is the complete list of bitwise operations (available for `Int` and `Long` only):

* `shl(bits)` – signed shift left (Java's `<<`)
* `shr(bits)` – signed shift right (Java's `>>`)
* `ushr(bits)` – unsigned shift right (Java's `>>>`)
* `and(bits)` – bitwise and
* `or(bits)` – bitwise or
* `xor(bits)` – bitwise xor
* `inv()` – bitwise inversion

## Characters

Characters are represented by the type `Char`. They can not be treated directly as numbers

``` kotlin
fun check(c: Char) {
    if (c == 1) { // ERROR: incompatible types
        // ...
    }
}
```

Character literals go in single quotes: `'1'`.
Special characters can be escaped using a backslash.
The following escape sequences are supported: `\t`, `\b`, `\n`, `\r`, `\'`, `\"`, `\\` and `\$`.
To encode any other character, use the Unicode escape sequence syntax: `'\uFF00'`.

We can explicitly convert a character to an `Int` number:

``` kotlin
fun decimalDigitValue(c: Char): Int {
    if (c !in '0'..'9')
        throw IllegalArgumentException("Out of range")
    return c.toInt() - '0'.toInt() // Explicit conversions to numbers
}
```

Like numbers, characters are boxed when a nullable reference is needed. Identity is not preserved by the boxing operation.

## Booleans

The type `Boolean` represents booleans, and has two values: *true*{: .keyword } and *false*{: .keyword }.

Booleans are boxed if a nullable reference is needed.

Built-in operations on booleans include

* `||` – lazy disjunction
* `&&` – lazy conjunction
* `!` - negation

## Arrays

Arrays in Kotlin are represented by the `Array` class, that has `get` and `set` functions (that turn into `[]` by operator overloading conventions), and `size` property, along with a few other useful member functions:

``` kotlin
class Array<T> private constructor() {
    val size: Int
    fun get(index: Int): T
    fun set(index: Int, value: T): Unit

    fun iterator(): Iterator<T>
    // ...
}
```

To create an array, we can use a library function `arrayOf()` and pass the item values to it, so that `arrayOf(1, 2, 3)` creates an array [1, 2, 3].
Alternatively, the `arrayOfNulls()` library function can be used to create an array of a given size filled with null elements.

Another option is to use a factory function that takes the array size and the function that can return the initial value
of each array element given its index:

``` kotlin
// Creates an Array<String> with values ["0", "1", "4", "9", "16"]
val asc = Array(5, { i -> (i * i).toString() })
```

As we said above, the `[]` operation stands for calls to member functions `get()` and `set()`.

Note: unlike Java, arrays in Kotlin are invariant. This means that Kotlin does not let us assign an `Array<String>`
to an `Array<Any>`, which prevents a possible runtime failure (but you can use `Array<out Any>`, 
see [Type Projections](generics.html#type-projections)).

Kotlin also has specialized classes to represent arrays of primitive types without boxing overhead: `ByteArray`,
`ShortArray`, `IntArray` and so on. These classes have no inheritance relation to the `Array` class, but they
have the same set of methods and properties. Each of them also has a corresponding factory function:

``` kotlin
val x: IntArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3)
x[0] = x[1] + x[2]
```

## Strings

Strings are represented by the type `String`. Strings are immutable.
Elements of a string are characters that can be accessed by the indexing operation: `s[i]`.
A string can be iterated over with a *for*{: .keyword }-loop:

``` kotlin
for (c in str) {
    println(c)
}
```

### String Literals

Kotlin has two types of string literals: escaped strings that may have escaped characters in them and raw strings that can contain newlines and arbitrary text. An escaped string is very much like a Java string:

``` kotlin
val s = "Hello, world!\n"
```

Escaping is done in the conventional way, with a backslash. See [Characters](#characters) above for the list of supported escape sequences.

A raw string is delimited by a triple quote (`"""`), contains no escaping and can contain newlines and any other characters:

``` kotlin
val text = """
    for (c in "foo")
        print(c)
"""
```

You can remove leading whitespace with [`trimMargin()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/trim-margin.html) function:

``` kotlin
val text = """
    |Tell me and I forget.
    |Teach me and I remember.
    |Involve me and I learn.
    |(Benjamin Franklin)
    """.trimMargin()
```

By default `|` is used as margin prefix, but you can choose another character and pass it as a parameter, like `trimMargin(">")`.

### String Templates

Strings may contain template expressions, i.e. pieces of code that are evaluated and whose results are concatenated into the string.
A template expression starts with a dollar sign ($) and consists of either a simple name:

``` kotlin
val i = 10
val s = "i = $i" // evaluates to "i = 10"
```

or an arbitrary expression in curly braces:

``` kotlin
val s = "abc"
val str = "$s.length is ${s.length}" // evaluates to "abc.length is 3"
```

Templates are supported both inside raw strings and inside escaped strings.
If you need to represent a literal `$` character in a raw string (which doesn't support backslash escaping), you can use the following syntax:

``` kotlin
val price = """
${'$'}9.99
"""
```
