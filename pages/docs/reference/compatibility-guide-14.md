# Compatibility Guide for Kotlin 1.4

[*Keeping the Language Modern* and *Comfortable Updates*](evolution/kotlin-evolution.html) are among the fundamental principles in Kotlin Language Design.
The former says that constructs which obstruct language evolution should be removed, and the latter says that this
removal should be well-communicated beforehand to make code migration as smooth as possible.

While most of the language changes were already announced through other channels, like update changelogs or compiler warnings,
this document summarizes them all, providing a complete reference for migration from Kotlin 1.3 to Kotlin 1.4.

## Basic terms

In this document we introduce several kinds of compatibility:

- _source_: source-incompatible change stops code that used to compile fine (without errors or warnings) from compiling anymore
- _binary_: two binary artifacts are said to be binary-compatible if interchanging them doesn't lead to loading or linkage errors 
- _behavioral_: a change is said to be behavioral-incompatible if the same program demonstrates different behavior before and after applying the change

Remember that those definitions are given only for pure Kotlin. Compatibility of Kotlin code from the other languages perspective
(for example, from Java) is out of the scope of this document.
