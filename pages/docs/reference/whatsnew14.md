# What's New in Kotlin 1.4

## Explicit API mode

Kotlin compiler offers _explicit API mode_ for library authors. In this mode, the compiler performs additional checks that
help make the library’s API clearer and more consistent. It adds the following requirements for declarations exposed
to the library’s public API:

* Visibility modifiers are required for declarations if the default visibility exposes them to the public API.
This helps ensure that no declarations are exposed to the public API unintentionally.
* Explicit type specifications are required for properties and functions that are exposed to the public API.
This guarantees that API users are aware of the types of API members they use.

Depending on your configuration, these explicit APIs can produce errors (_strict_ mode) or warnings (_warning_ mode).
Certain kinds of declarations are excluded from such checks for the sake of readability and common sense:

* primary constructors
* properties of data classes
* property getters and setters
* `override` methods

Explicit API mode analyzes only the production sources of a module.

To compile your module in the explicit API mode, add the following lines to your Gradle build script:

<div class="multi-language-sample" data-lang="groovy">
<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" mode='groovy'>

```groovy
kotlin {    
    // for strict mode
    explicitApi() 
    // or
    explicitApi = 'strict'
    
    // for warning mode
    explicitApiWarning()
    // or
    explicitApi = 'warning'
}
```

</div>
</div>

<div class="multi-language-sample" data-lang="kotlin">
<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" mode='kotlin' data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
kotlin {    
    // for strict mode
    explicitApi() 
    // or
    explicitApi = ExplicitApiMode.Strict
    
    // for warning mode
    explicitApiWarning()
    // or
    explicitApi = ExplicitApiMode.Warning
}
```

</div>
</div>

When using the command-line compiler, switch to explicit API mode by adding  the `-Xexplicit-api` compiler option
with the value `strict` or `warning`.

<div class="sample" markdown="1" mode="shell" theme="idea">

```bash
-Xexplicit-api={strict|warning}
```

</div>

## Kotlin/Native

### Simplified management of CocoaPods dependencies

Previously, once you integrated your project with the dependency manager CocoaPods, you could build an iOS, macOS, watchOS, 
or tvOS part of your project only in Xcode, separate from other parts of your multiplatform project. These other parts could 
be built in Intellij IDEA. 

Moreover, every time you added a dependency on an Objective-C library stored in CocoaPods (Pod library), you had to switch 
from IntelliJ IDEA to Xcode, call `pod install`, and run the Xcode build there. 

Now you can manage Pod dependencies right in Intellij IDEA while enjoying the benefits it provides for working with code, 
such as code highlighting and completion. You can also build the whole Kotlin project with Gradle, without having to 
switch to Xcode. This means you only have to go to Xcode when you need to write Swift/Objective-C code or run your application 
on a simulator or device.

Now you can also work with Pod libraries stored locally.

Depending on your needs, you can add dependencies between:
* A Kotlin project and Pod libraries stored remotely in the CocoaPods repository or stored locally on your machine.
* A Kotlin Pod (Kotlin project used as a CocoaPods dependency) and an Xcode project with one or more targets.
* Several Kotlin Pods and an Xcode project.

Complete the initial configuration, and when you add a new dependency to `cocoapods`, just re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA. 
The new dependency will be added automatically. No additional steps are required.
