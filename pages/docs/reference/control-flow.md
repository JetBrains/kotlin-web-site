# Control Flow

## If Expression

In Kotlin, *if*{: .keyword } is an expression, i.e. it returns a value.
Therefore there is no ternary operator (condition ? then : else), because ordinary *if*{: .keyword } works fine in this role.

``` kotlin
// Traditional usage 
var max = a 
if (a < b) max = b

// With else 
var max: Int
if (a > b) {
    max = a
} else {
    max = b
}
 
// As expression 
val max = if (a > b) a else b
```

*if*{: .keyword } branches can be blocks, and the last expression is the value of a block:

``` kotlin
val max = if (a > b) {
    print("Choose a")
    a
} else {
    print("Choose b")
    b
}
```

If you're using *if*{: .keyword } as an expression rather than a statement (for example, returning its value or
assigning it to a variable), the expression is required to have an `else` branch.

See the [grammar for *if*{: .keyword }](grammar.html#if).

## When Expression

*when*{: .keyword } replaces the switch operator of C-like languages. In the simplest form it looks like this

``` kotlin
when (x) {
    1 -> print("x == 1")
    2 -> print("x == 2")
    else -> { // Note the block
        print("x is neither 1 nor 2")
    }
}
```

*when*{: .keyword } matches its argument against all branches sequentially until some branch condition is satisfied.
*when*{: .keyword } can be used either as an expression or as a statement. If it is used as an expression, the value
of the satisfied branch becomes the value of the overall expression. If it is used as a statement, the values of
individual branches are ignored. (Just like with *if*{: .keyword }, each branch can be a block, and its value
is the value of the last expression in the block.)

The *else*{: .keyword } branch is evaluated if none of the other branch conditions are satisfied.
If *when*{: .keyword } is used as an expression, the *else*{: .keyword } branch is mandatory,
unless the compiler can prove that all possible cases are covered with branch conditions.

If many cases should be handled in the same way, the branch conditions may be combined with a comma:

``` kotlin
when (x) {
    0, 1 -> print("x == 0 or x == 1")
    else -> print("otherwise")
}
```

We can use arbitrary expressions (not only constants) as branch conditions

``` kotlin
when (x) {
    parseInt(s) -> print("s encodes x")
    else -> print("s does not encode x")
}
```

We can also check a value for being *in*{: .keyword } or *!in*{: .keyword } a [range](ranges.html) or a collection:

``` kotlin
when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> print("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> print("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> print("x is outside the range")
    else -> print("none of the above")
}
```

Another possibility is to check that a value *is*{: .keyword } or *!is*{: .keyword } of a particular type. Note that,
due to [smart casts](typecasts.html#smart-casts), you can access the methods and properties of the type without
any extra checks.

```kotlin
val hasPrefix = when(x) {
    is String -> x.startsWith("prefix")
    else -> false
}
```

*when*{: .keyword } can also be used as a replacement for an *if*{: .keyword }-*else*{: .keyword } *if*{: .keyword } chain.
If no argument is supplied, the branch conditions are simply boolean expressions, and a branch is executed when its condition is true:

``` kotlin
when {
    x.isOdd() -> print("x is odd")
    x.isEven() -> print("x is even")
    else -> print("x is funny")
}
```

See the [grammar for *when*{: .keyword }](grammar.html#when).


## For Loops

*for*{: .keyword } loop iterates through anything that provides an iterator. The syntax is as follows:

``` kotlin
for (item in collection) print(item)
```

The body can be a block.

``` kotlin
for (item: Int in ints) {
    // ...
}
```

As mentioned before, *for*{: .keyword } iterates through anything that provides an iterator, i.e.

* has a member- or extension-function `iterator()`, whose return type
  * has a member- or extension-function `next()`, and
  * has a member- or extension-function `hasNext()` that returns `Boolean`.

All of these three functions need to be marked as `operator`.

A `for` loop over an array is compiled to an index-based loop that does not create an iterator object.

If you want to iterate through an array or a list with an index, you can do it this way:

``` kotlin
for (i in array.indices) {
    print(array[i])
}
```

Note that this "iteration through a range" is compiled down to optimal implementation with no extra objects created.

Alternatively, you can use the `withIndex` library function:

``` kotlin
for ((index, value) in array.withIndex()) {
    println("the element at $index is $value")
}
```

See the [grammar for *for*{: .keyword }](grammar.html#for).

## While Loops

*while*{: .keyword } and *do*{: .keyword }..*while*{: .keyword } work as usual

``` kotlin
while (x > 0) {
    x--
}

do {
    val y = retrieveData()
} while (y != null) // y is visible here!
```

See the [grammar for *while*{: .keyword }](grammar.html#while).

## Break and continue in loops

Kotlin supports traditional *break*{: .keyword } and *continue*{: .keyword } operators in loops. See [Returns and jumps](returns.html).
