# Operator overloading

Kotlin allows us to provide implementations for a predefined set of operators on our types. These operators have fixed symbolic representation
(like `+` or `*`) and fixed [precedence](grammar.html#precedence). To implement an operator, we provide a [member function](functions.html#member-functions)
or an [extension function](extensions.html) with a fixed name, for the corresponding type, i.e. left-hand side type for binary operations and argument type for unary ones.
Functions that overload operators need to be marked with the `operator` modifier.

Further we describe the conventions that regulate operator overloading for different operators.

## Unary operations

### Unary prefix operators

| Expression | Translated to |
|------------|---------------|
| `+a` | `a.unaryPlus()` |
| `-a` | `a.unaryMinus()` |
| `!a` | `a.not()` |

This table says that when the compiler processes, for example, an expression `+a`, it performs the following steps:

* Determines the type of `a`, let it be `T`;
* Looks up a function `unaryPlus()` with the `operator` modifier and no parameters for the receiver `T`, i.e. a member function or an extension function;
* If the function is absent or ambiguous, it is a compilation error;
* If the function is present and its return type is `R`, the expression `+a` has type `R`;

*Note* that these operations, as well as all the others, are optimized for [Basic types](basic-types.html) and do not introduce overhead of function calls for them.

As an example, here's how you can overload the unary minus operator:

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea">
``` kotlin
data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)

operator fun Point.unaryMinus() = Point(-x, -y)

val point = Point(10, 20)

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
   println(-point)  // prints "Point(x=-10, y=-20)"
}

```
</div>

### Increments and decrements

| Expression | Translated to |
|------------|---------------|
| `a++` | `a.inc()` + see below |
| `a--` | `a.dec()` + see below |

The `inc()` and `dec()` functions must return a value, which will be assigned to the variable on which the
`++` or `--` operation was used. They shouldn't mutate the object on which the `inc` or `dec` was invoked.

The compiler performs the following steps for resolution of an operator in the *postfix* form, e.g. `a++`:

* Determines the type of `a`, let it be `T`;
* Looks up a function `inc()` with the `operator` modifier and no parameters, applicable to the receiver of type `T`;
* Checks that the return type of the function is a subtype of `T`.

The effect of computing the expression is:

* Store the initial value of `a` to a temporary storage `a0`;
* Assign the result of `a.inc()` to `a`;
* Return `a0` as a result of the expression.

For `a--` the steps are completely analogous.

For the *prefix* forms `++a` and `--a` resolution works the same way, and the effect is:

* Assign the result of `a.inc()` to `a`;
* Return the new value of `a` as a result of the expression.

## Binary operations

{:#arithmetic}

### Arithmetic operators 

| Expression | Translated to |
| -----------|-------------- |
| `a + b` | `a.plus(b)` |
| `a - b` | `a.minus(b)` |
| `a * b` | `a.times(b)` |
| `a / b` | `a.div(b)` |
| `a % b` | `a.rem(b)`, `a.mod(b)` (deprecated) |
| `a..b ` | `a.rangeTo(b)` |

For the operations in this table, the compiler just resolves the expression in the *Translated to* column.

Note that the `rem` operator is supported since Kotlin 1.1. Kotlin 1.0 uses the `mod` operator, which is deprecated
in Kotlin 1.1.


#### Example

Below is an example Counter class that starts at a given value and can be incremented using the overloaded `+` operator:

``` kotlin
data class Counter(val dayIndex: Int) {
    operator fun plus(increment: Int): Counter {
        return Counter(dayIndex + increment)
    }
}
```

{:#in}

### 'In' operator


| Expression | Translated to |
| -----------|-------------- |
| `a in b` | `b.contains(a)` |
| `a !in b` | `!b.contains(a)` |

For `in` and `!in` the procedure is the same, but the order of arguments is reversed.

{:#indexed}

### Indexed access operator

| Expression | Translated to |
| -------|-------------- |
| `a[i]`  | `a.get(i)` |
| `a[i, j]`  | `a.get(i, j)` |
| `a[i_1, ...,  i_n]`  | `a.get(i_1, ...,  i_n)` |
| `a[i] = b` | `a.set(i, b)` |
| `a[i, j] = b` | `a.set(i, j, b)` |
| `a[i_1, ...,  i_n] = b` | `a.set(i_1, ..., i_n, b)` |

Square brackets are translated to calls to `get` and `set` with appropriate numbers of arguments.

{:#invoke}

### Invoke operator

| Expression | Translated to |
|--------|---------------|
| `a()`  | `a.invoke()` |
| `a(i)`  | `a.invoke(i)` |
| `a(i, j)`  | `a.invoke(i, j)` |
| `a(i_1, ...,  i_n)`  | `a.invoke(i_1, ...,  i_n)` |

Parentheses are translated to calls to `invoke` with appropriate number of arguments.

{:#assignments}

### Augmented assignments

| Expression | Translated to |
|------------|---------------|
| `a += b` | `a.plusAssign(b)` |
| `a -= b` | `a.minusAssign(b)` |
| `a *= b` | `a.timesAssign(b)` |
| `a /= b` | `a.divAssign(b)` |
| `a %= b` | `a.remAssign(b)`, `a.modAssign(b)` (deprecated) |

For the assignment operations, e.g. `a += b`, the compiler performs the following steps:

* If the function from the right column is available
  * If the corresponding binary function (i.e. `plus()` for `plusAssign()`) is available too, report error (ambiguity),
  * Make sure its return type is `Unit`, and report an error otherwise,
  * Generate code for `a.plusAssign(b)`;
* Otherwise, try to generate code for `a = a + b` (this includes a type check: the type of `a + b` must be a subtype of `a`).

*Note*: assignments are *NOT* expressions in Kotlin.

{:#equals}

### Equality and inequality operators

| Expression | Translated to |
|------------|---------------|
| `a == b` | `a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null)` |
| `a != b` | `!(a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null))` |

*Note*: `===` and `!==` (identity checks) are not overloadable, so no conventions exist for them.

The `==` operation is special: it is translated to a complex expression that screens for `null`'s.
`null == null` is always true, and `x == null` for a non-null `x` is always false and won't invoke `x.equals()`.

{:#comparison}

### Comparison operators

| Expression | Translated to |
|--------|---------------|
| `a > b`  | `a.compareTo(b) > 0` |
| `a < b`  | `a.compareTo(b) < 0` |
| `a >= b` | `a.compareTo(b) >= 0` |
| `a <= b` | `a.compareTo(b) <= 0` |

All comparisons are translated into calls to `compareTo`, that is required to return `Int`.

### Property delegation operators
`provideDelegate`, `getValue` and `setValue` operator functions are described
in [Delegated properties](delegated-properties.html).

## Infix calls for named functions

We can simulate custom infix operations by using [infix function calls](functions.html#infix-notation).
