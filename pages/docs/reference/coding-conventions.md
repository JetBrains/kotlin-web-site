# Coding Conventions

This page contains the current coding style for the Kotlin language.

## Naming Style
If in doubt, default to the Java Coding Conventions such as:

* use of camelCase for names (and avoid underscore in names)
* types start with upper case
* methods and properties start with lower case
* use 4 space indentation
* public functions should have documentation such that it appears in Kotlin Doc

## Colon

There is a space before colon where colon separates type and supertype and there's no space where colon separates instance and type:

``` kotlin
interface Foo<out T : Any> : Bar {
    fun foo(a: Int): T
}
```

## Lambdas

In lambda expressions, spaces should be used around the curly braces, as well as around the arrow which separates the parameters
from the body. Whenever possible, a lambda should be passed outside of parentheses.

``` kotlin
list.filter { it > 10 }.map { element -> element * 2 }
```

In lambdas which are short and not nested, it's recommended to use the `it` convention instead of declaring the parameter
explicitly. In nested lambdas with parameters, parameters should be always declared explicitly.

## Class header formatting

Classes with a few arguments can be written in a single line:

```kotlin
class Person(id: Int, name: String)
```

Classes with longer headers should be formatted so that each primary constructor argument is in a separate line with indentation.
Also, the closing parenthesis should be on a new line. If we use inheritance, then the superclass constructor call or list of implemented interfaces
should be located on the same line as the parenthesis:

```kotlin
class Person(
    id: Int,
    name: String,
    surname: String
) : Human(id, name) {
    // ...
}
```

For multiple interfaces, the superclass constructor call should be located first and then each interface should be located in a different line:

```kotlin
class Person(
    id: Int,
    name: String,
    surname: String
) : Human(id, name),
    KotlinMaker {
    // ...
}
```

Constructor parameters can use either the regular indent or the continuation indent (double the regular indent).

## Unit

If a function returns Unit, the return type should be omitted:

``` kotlin
fun foo() { // ": Unit" is omitted here

}
```

## Functions vs Properties

In some cases functions with no arguments might be interchangeable with read-only properties.
Although the semantics are similar, there are some stylistic conventions on when to prefer one to another.

Prefer a property over a function when the underlying algorithm:

* does not throw any Exceptions
* has a `O(1)` complexity
* is cheap to calculate (or ca—Åhed on the first run)
* returns the same result over invocations
