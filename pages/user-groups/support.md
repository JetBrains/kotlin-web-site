# Guidelines

## What is a KUG?

A Kotlin User Group, or KUG, is a community that is  dedicated to Kotlin and that offers you a place to share your
 Kotlin programming experience with like-minded people. 

To become an KUG, your community should have some specific features shared by every KUG. It should: 
* Provide Kotlin-related content, with regular meetups as the main form of activity.
* Host regular events (at least once every 3 months) with open registration and without any restriction for attendance. 
* Be driven and organized by the community, and it should not use events to earn money or gain any other business
 benefits from members and attendees.
* Follow and ensure a code of conduct in order to provide a welcoming environment for attendees of any background and
 experience (check-out our recommended [Code of Conduct](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+Open+Source+and+Community+Code+of+Conduct?_ga=2.196540523.635003367.1591004320-634043455.1590756936)).

There are no limits regarding the format for KUG meetups. They can take place in whatever fashion works best for the
 community, whether that includes presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers. 

## How to run a KUG?

* In order to promote group cohesion and prevent miscommunication, we recommend keeping to a limit of one KUG per city. Check out [the list of KUGs](/user-groups/user-group-list.html) to see if there is already a KUG in your area.
* Use the official KUG logo and branding. Check out [the branding guidelines](/user-groups/branding.html).
* Keep your user group active. Run meetups regularly, at least once every 3 months.
* Announce your KUG meetups at least 2 weeks in advance. The announcement should contain a list of talks
 and the names of the speakers, as well as the location, timing, and any other crucial info about the event. 
* KUG events should be free or, if you need to cover organizing expenses, limit prices to a maximum of 10 USD.
* Your group should have a code of conduct available for all members. 

If your community has all the necessary features and follows these guidelines, you are ready to [Apply to be a new
