## Guidelines
* User groups provide activities to support professionals interested in the technology.
* Try to meet up regularly. It is the best way to increase Kotlin excellence for all members of the user group.
* All the events and materials should be public and available for people of any background.
* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience.
* Follow these simple rules to collaborate efficiently: be kind, be someone that other people want to be around, do not insult or be rude to other attendees. Collaboration and respect will help you to achieve your personal goals and create a welcoming environment for new members.
* We recommend setting out a Code of Conduct in your Kotlin User Group to help encourage inclusive behavior.

Disclaimer: Kotlin User Groups are not affiliates of JetBrains nor Google. They are independently run organizations.
