If there is no KUG in your area, make a new one.
If you are a leader of active user group and it’s not in a list, please, let us know that there is a Kotlin User Group. We will share the information with others on this site, on our twitter and in Slack channel.

Guidelines
User group provides activities to support professionals interested in a technology
Try to meet up regularly. It is the best way to increase Kotlin excellence for all members of the user group
All the events and materials should be public and available for people of any different backgrounds
All communication should be appropriate for the professional audience
Follow simple rules to collaborate efficiently: be kind, be someone that other people want to be around, do not insult or bring down other attendees. Collaboration and respect would help you to achieve your personal goals and create proper environment for the fellows.
