Kotlin Night is a meetup that includes 3-4 talks on Kotlin or related technologies.  At JetBrains we've organised a few events: [Kotlin Night San Francisco](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/06/kotlin-night-recordings/) and [Kotlin Night London](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/11/kotlin-night-in-london-recordings/).

The community however is asking for more Kotlin Nights and are willing to organise these themselves. Here you would find guidelines and some hints on putting things together.
