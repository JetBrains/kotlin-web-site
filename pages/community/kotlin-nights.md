# Kotlin Nights

Kotlin Night is a meetup that includes 3-4 talks on Kotlin or related technologies.
At JetBrains we've organised a few events: 
[Kotlin Night San Francisco](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/06/kotlin-night-recordings/) and 
[Kotlin Night London](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/11/kotlin-night-in-london-recordings/). 
 
The community however is asking for more Kotlin Nights and are willing to organise these themselves. Here you would find guidelines and some hints on putting things together. 

Please, [submit your Kotlin Night](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/1eca96c71ee7) to get support and inform about your upcoming event.

## Guidelines

* Please, stick with the design materials. It will help to have all events and materials with the same style
* Kotlin Night should be a free event. A minimal fee can be charged to assure assistance but it is still a non-profit event. 
* The event should be published and available publicly for all people to attend without any kind of discrimination.
* The contents of the talks should be made public online after the event without requiring sign-up or registration to access these.
* Recording is optional but recommended and should also be made available
* The talks should be primarily about Kotlin and not a focus on marketing or sales
* The event can serve food and/or drinks optionally

  * There is enough place as well as food and beverages, in case you provide, for everyone. 
  * You have a plan with your speakers: schedule, topics and abstracts of the talks, equipment for the presentations.
  * If you’d like to organise recording of the talks, plan it in advance to get a better quality
2. Content and speakers
  * Feel free to invite people with talks from your local community, from the neighbour countries or even from all over the globe. You don’t have to have any JetBrains representative or speaker at your event. However we would be glad to learn about one more Kotlin Night, so feel free to notify us.

  * Add timeline, topics, abstracts and speakers bios to the announcement
  * Spread the word in social media
