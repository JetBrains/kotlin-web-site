# We're all Kotlin

The community around Kotlin is rapidly growing, and every single day brings something new: awesome eliminating talks, Kotlin user groups meetups, various projects written in Kotlin. We do all our best to provide platforms for easy communication, help to bring into play all your initiatives and keep up to speed. This section of the site gives the idea how and where you can find the news and support and provides guidelines for events organizers.      


## Kotlin real-life Activities

1. **Local Kotlin User Groups** is a place to share experience between Kotlin programmers. 
   Likewise, bring information about the technology to everyone who is interested. 
   Regular activities is the main idea of user groups. 
   The main goal is to provide support and opportunities for experience sharing and increasing engineering excellence. 
2. **Kotlin Nights** are one-off events that usually include 3-4 talks on Kotlin. 
   The talks should be dedicated to technology, either to Kotlin or to some other compatible approaches 
   and not be focused on marketing, sales or commercials.
