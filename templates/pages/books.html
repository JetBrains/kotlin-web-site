        <p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-kotlin">The Joy of Kotlin</a>
            teaches you the right way to code in Kotlin. In this insight-rich book,
            you'll master the Kotlin language while exploring coding techniques that will make you a better developer
            no matter what language you use. Kotlin natively supports a functional style of programming,
            so seasoned author Pierre-Yves Saumont begins by reviewing the FP principles of immutability,
            referential transparency, and the separation between functions and effects.
            Then, you'll move deeper into using Kotlin in the real world, as you learn to handle errors and data
            properly,
            encapsulate shared state mutations, and work with laziness. This book will change the way you code — and
            give you back some of the joy you had when you first started.

            begins by giving you a strong grasp of Kotlin’s features in the context of Android
            development and its APIs. Moving on, you’ll take steps toward building stunning applications for Android.
            The book will show you how to set up the environment, and the difficulty level will grow steadily
            with the applications covered in the upcoming chapters.
            Later on, the book will introduce you to the Android Studio IDE, which plays an integral role
            in Android development. We’ll use Kotlin’s basic programming concepts such as functions,
            lambdas, properties, object-oriented code, safety aspects, type parameterization, testing,
            and concurrency, which will guide you through writing Kotlin code into production. We’ll also show
            you how to integrate Kotlin into any existing Android project.</p>

            takes you through the building blocks of Kotlin, such as functions and classes.
            You’ll explore various features of Kotlin by building three applications of varying complexity.
            For a quick start to Android development, we look at building a classic game,
            Tetris, and elaborate on object-oriented programming in Kotlin. Our next application will be
            a messenger app, a level up in terms of complexity. Before moving onto the third app, we take
            a look at data persistent methods, helping us learn about the storage and retrieval of useful applications.
            Our final app is a place reviewer: a web application that will make use
            of the Google Maps API and Place Picker.</p>
