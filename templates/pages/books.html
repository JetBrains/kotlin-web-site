    is a book by Iyanu Adelekan enhancing your Kotlin programming skills by building 3 real-world applications. 
    You’ll explore various features of Kotlin by building three applications of varying complexity. 
    For a quick start to Android development, we look at building a classic game, Tetris, and elaborate on object-oriented programming in Kotlin. 
    Our next application will be a messenger app, a level up in terms of complexity. 
    Before moving onto the third app, we take a look at data persistent methods, helping us learn about the storage and retrieval of useful applications. 
    Our final app is a place reviewer: a web application that will make use of the Google Maps API and Place Picker.</p>
