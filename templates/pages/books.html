        <p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-kotlin">The Joy of Kotlin</a>
            teaches you the right way to code in Kotlin. In this insight-rich book,
            you'll master the Kotlin language while exploring coding techniques that will make you a better developer
            no matter what language you use. Kotlin natively supports a functional style of programming,
            so seasoned author Pierre-Yves Saumont begins by reviewing the FP principles of immutability,
            referential transparency, and the separation between functions and effects.
            Then, you'll move deeper into using Kotlin in the real world, as you learn to handle errors and data
            properly,
            encapsulate shared state mutations, and work with laziness. This book will change the way you code â€” and
            give you back some of the joy you had when you first started.

            begins by giving you a strong grasp of Kotlinâ€™s features in the context of Android
            development and its APIs. Moving on, youâ€™ll take steps toward building stunning applications for Android.
            The book will show you how to set up the environment, and the difficulty level will grow steadily
            with the applications covered in the upcoming chapters.
            Later on, the book will introduce you to the Android Studio IDE, which plays an integral role
            in Android development. Weâ€™ll use Kotlinâ€™s basic programming concepts such as functions,
            lambdas, properties, object-oriented code, safety aspects, type parameterization, testing,
            and concurrency, which will guide you through writing Kotlin code into production. Weâ€™ll also show
            you how to integrate Kotlin into any existing Android project.</p>

            takes you through the building blocks of Kotlin, such as functions and classes.
            Youâ€™ll explore various features of Kotlin by building three applications of varying complexity.
            For a quick start to Android development, we look at building a classic game,
            Tetris, and elaborate on object-oriented programming in Kotlin. Our next application will be
            a messenger app, a level up in terms of complexity. Before moving onto the third app, we take
            a look at data persistent methods, helping us learn about the storage and retrieval of useful applications.
            Our final app is a place reviewer: a web application that will make use
            of the Google Maps API and Place Picker.</p>

            before heading into functional programming. It then takes you through reactive and
            concurrent patterns, teaching you about using streams, threads, and coroutines to write better
            code along the way. By the end of the book, you will be able to efficiently address
            common problems faced while developing applications and be comfortable working

        <p><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-standard-library-cookbook">Kotlin Standard Library Cookbook</a> 
            by Samuel Urbanowicz will help you dive into advanced language concepts and features. It covers a wide range of general programming problems at varying difficulty levels, 
            including design patterns, functional programming, data processing, and more. The book consists of recipes that present 
            a specific problem and give a step-by-step explanation of how to approach it effectively.
            This book will help you switch to Kotlin with ease and integrate it seamlessly into the existing JVM, Android and JavaScript projects.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1788474643"> Learning Kotlin by building Android Applications</a>
            by Eunice Adutwumwaa Obugyei. This book adopts a project-style approach,
            where we focus on teaching Android development by building three different
            Android Applications: a Tic-Tac-Toe application, a location- based alarm and a To-Do list
            application. The book begins by giving you a strong grasp of the Kotlin language and its
            APIs as a preliminary to building stunning applications for Android. You'll learn to set up
            an environment and as you progress through the chapters and the building of the different
            applications, the difficulty level will steadily grow. The book also introduces you
            to the Android Studio IDE, which plays an integral role in Android Development. I
            t covers Kotlin's basic programming concepts such as functions, lambdas, properties,
            object-oriented code, safety aspects and type parameterization, testing, and concurrency,
            and helps you write Kotlin code to production. Finally, you'll be taken through the process
            of releasing your app on the Google Play Store. You will also be introduced to other app
            distribution channels such as Amazon App Store.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/178899664X">Mastering High Performance with Kotlin</a>
            The book starts by analyzing various Kotlin specifcations to identify those that have a potentially
            adverse effect on performance. Then, we move on to monitor techniques that
            enable us to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize performance metrics.
            Next, we look at techniques that help to us achieve high performance: memory optimization,
            concurrency, multi threading, scaling, and caching. We also look at fault tolerance
            solutions and the importance of logging. We'll also cover best practices of Kotlin
            programming that will help you to improve the quality of your code base.
            By the end of the book, you will have gained some insight into various techniques and
            solutions that will help to create high-performance applications in the Kotlin environment.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/178899664X">Learning Concurrency in Kotlin</a>
            This book describes new approaches to concurrency and creates
            unique challenges for the design and implementation of concurrent code.
            'Learning Concurrency in Kotlin' addresses the challenges of
            concurrent implementation with real-life examples and exercises that
            take advantage of Kotlinâ€™s primitives. Beginning with an introduction to
            Kotlinâ€™s coroutines, you will learn how to write concurrent code and understand
            the fundamental concepts needed to write multithreaded software in Kotlin.
            Youâ€™ll explore how to communicate between and synchronize your threads and
            coroutines to write asynchronous applications that are collaborative.
            Youâ€™ll also learn how to handle errors and exceptions, as well as how to
            leverage multi-core processing. In addition to this, youâ€™ll delve into how
            coroutines work internally, allowing you to see the bigger picture.
            Through the book, youâ€™ll build an Android application â€“ an RSS reader â€“ designed
            and implemented according to the different topics covered in the book.</p>
