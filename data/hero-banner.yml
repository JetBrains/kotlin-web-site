### Hero Banner
#
# All banners that have `variant` are hidden by default. This is needed for A/B testing through Optimizely.  
# If you don't use variations, use a list with one element without this attribute:
#
# ---
#- title: "<title>"
#  caption: "<caption>" 
#  buttonLabel: "<button text>"
#  buttonUrl: "<url>"
