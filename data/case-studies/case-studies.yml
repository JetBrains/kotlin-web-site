      Varsha Singh Project Manager, McDonald’s app at Umain “After a successful initial test with the
      payments feature, we expanded Kotlin Multiplatform to our entire McDonald's application. With KMP, we
      saw fewer crashes and better performance across both platforms after the launch. We transitioned from a
      separate Android and iOS team to a more unified mobile team.”
