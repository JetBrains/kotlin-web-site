What should I do to migrate it to other platforms?</h3><p id="-yacclz_93">Migration of the app consists of two parts: migrating the UI and migrating the logic. The complexity of the migration depends on the complexity of your application and the amount of Android-specific libraries you use. You can migrate most of your screens to Compose Multiplatform without changes. All of the Jetpack Compose widgets are supported. However, some APIs work only in the Android target &ndash; they might be Android-specific or have yet to be ported to other platforms. For instance, resource handling is Android-specific, so you would need to migrate to the <a href="compose-multiplatform-resources.html" id="-yacclz_96">Compose Multiplatform resource library</a> or use a community solution. The Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation" id="-yacclz_97" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigation library</a> is also Android-specific, but there are <a href="compose-navigation-routing.html" id="-yacclz_98">community alternatives</a> available.

If you embed native iOS components into your screen, updates may affect their appearance.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="future-plans" data-toc="future-plans">Future plans</h2><section class="chapter"><h3 id="what-are-the-plans-for-the-kotlin-multiplatform-evolution" data-toc="what-are-the-plans-for-the-kotlin-multiplatform-evolution">What are the plans for the Kotlin Multiplatform evolution?</h3><p id="-yacclz_117">We at JetBrains are investing much to provide the best experience for multiplatform development and eliminate existing pains of multiplatform users. We have plans for improving the core Kotlin Multiplatform technology, integration with the Apple ecosystem, tooling, and our Compose Multiplatform UI framework. <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/10/kotlin-multiplatform-development-roadmap-for-2025/" id="-yacclz_118" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out our roadmap</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="when-will-compose-multiplatform-become-stable" data-toc="when-will-compose-multiplatform-become-stable">When will Compose Multiplatform become Stable?</h3><p id="-yacclz_119">Compose Multiplatform is Stable for Android, iOS, and desktop, while the web platform support is in Alpha. We are working towards a stable release for the web platform, with exact dates to be announced.</p><p id="-yacclz_120">For more information on stability statuses, see <a href="supported-platforms.html" id="-yacclz_121">Supported platforms</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="what-about-future-support-for-web-targets-in-kotlin-and-compose-multiplatform" data-toc="what-about-future-support-for-web-targets-in-kotlin-and-compose-multiplatform">What about future support for web targets in Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform?</h3><p id="-yacclz_122">We're currently focusing resources on WebAssembly (Wasm), which shows great potential. You can experiment with our new <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html" id="-yacclz_125" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin/Wasm backend</a> and <a href="https://kotl.in/wasm-compose-example" id="-yacclz_126" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compose Multiplatform for Web</a> powered by Wasm.</p><p id="-yacclz_123">As for the JS target, the Kotlin/JS backend has already reached Stable status. In Compose Multiplatform, due to resource constraints, we've shifted our focus from JS Canvas to Wasm, which we believe holds more promise.</p><p id="-yacclz_124">We also offer Compose HTML, previously known as Compose Multiplatform for web. It's an additional library designed for working with the DOM in Kotlin/JS, and it's not intended for sharing UIs across platforms.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="are-there-any-plans-to-improve-tooling-for-multiplatform-development" data-toc="are-there-any-plans-to-improve-tooling-for-multiplatform-development">Are there any plans to improve tooling for multiplatform development?</h3><p id="-yacclz_127">Yes, we're acutely aware of the current challenges with multiplatform tooling and are actively working on enhancements in several areas.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="are-you-going-to-provide-a-swift-interop" data-toc="are-you-going-to-provide-a-swift-interop">Are you going to provide a Swift interop?</h3><p id="-yacclz_128">Yes.
