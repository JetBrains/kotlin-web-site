Indeed, cross-platform programming is becoming increasingly popular in the context of software development. It is particularly prevalent in the area of mobile apps, but its use is by no means limited to these types of applications. As businesses strive to reach broader audiences across multiple devices and operating systems, developers are turning to versatile languages and frameworks that erase platform barriers.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_5">If you&rsquo;re wondering which programming language would best equip you to get started with cross-platform development, this overview article will steer you in the right direction, offering insights and real use-case examples.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="understanding-cross-platform-development" data-toc="understanding-cross-platform-development">Understanding cross-platform development</h2><p id="-vv0mnv_11">Cross-platform application development refers to the development approach where a single codebase can be used to create software that runs on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers, among others. This approach has gained popularity in recent years, thanks in large part to the growing demand for mobile apps. Mobile engineers can share some or all of the source code between iOS and Android instead of developing separate applications for each platform.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_12">We have a dedicated guide where you can read more about the benefits and limitations of both <a href="native-and-cross-platform.html" id="-vv0mnv_15">native and cross-platform development</a> and how to choose between these two approaches.

Various cross-platform technologies have their own unique pros and cons, but ultimately, it all comes down to your goals and requirements for the software you want to build.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_98">When choosing a language or framework for your project, you should keep several important factors in mind. These include the type of your application, its performance and UX requirements, associated tooling, and various other concerns that are described in detail below.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_99"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_117">1. The type of application</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_100">Different programming languages and frameworks are better supported on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web browsers. Certain languages are naturally more suitable for specific platforms and projects.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_101"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_118">2. Performance and UX requirements</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_102">Certain types of applications have specific performance and user experience (UX) requirements, which can be measured by different criteria, like speed, responsiveness, memory usage, and their consumption of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Consider the functions that your future application will need to fulfill and your desired parameters for the above criteria.</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="tip" data-title="" id="-vv0mnv_103"><p id="-vv0mnv_119">For example, a graphics-intensive game app might benefit from a language that can efficiently utilize the GPU. Meanwhile, a business app might prioritize ease of database integration and network communication.</p></aside><p id="-vv0mnv_104"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_120">3. Existing skill set and learning curve</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_105">When making a choice of a technology for their next project, a development team should take into account their previous experience. Introducing a new language or tool requires time for training, which sometimes can delay the project. The steeper the learning curve, the longer it will take for the team to become proficient.</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="tip" data-title="" id="-vv0mnv_106"><p id="-vv0mnv_121">For example, if your team consists of highly proficient JavaScript developers and you lack the resources to adopt new technologies, it might be beneficial to select frameworks that utilize JavaScript, like React Native.</p></aside><p id="-vv0mnv_107"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_122">4. Existing use cases</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_108">Another important factor to consider is the real-world use of the technology. Reviewing case studies from companies that have successfully implemented specific cross-platform languages or frameworks can provide valuable insights into how these technologies perform in production. This can help you evaluate whether a particular technology is suitable for your project&rsquo;s goals. For example, you can explore case studies of companies leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform to develop production-ready applications across various platforms.</p><figure id="-vv0mnv_109"><img alt="Kotlin Multiplatform Case Studies" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/kmp-case-studies.png" title="Kotlin Multiplatform Case Studies" width="700" height="394"></figure><p id="-vv0mnv_110"><a href="case-studies.html" id="-vv0mnv_123"><figure id="-vv0mnv_124"><img alt="Explore Real-World Kotlin Multiplatform Use Cases" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/kmp-use-cases-1.svg" title="Explore Real-World Kotlin Multiplatform Use Cases" width="500" height="43"></figure></a></p><p id="-vv0mnv_111"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_125">5. Language ecosystem</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_112">Another important factor is the maturity of the language&rsquo;s ecosystem. Pay attention to the availability and quality of tools and libraries that support multiplatform development. For example, JavaScript has a vast number of libraries, which support frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js), backend development (Express, NestJS), and a wide range of other functionalities.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_113">Similarly, Flutter has a significant and rapidly growing number of libraries, also known as packages or plugins. Though Kotlin Multiplatform has fewer libraries currently, its ecosystem is growing rapidly and the language is being enhanced by many Kotlin developers across the world. The infographics below show how the number of Kotlin Multiplatform libraries has grown over the years.</p><figure id="-vv0mnv_114"><img alt="Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries Over Years" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/kmp-libs-over-years.png" title="Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries Over Years" width="700" height="394"></figure><p id="-vv0mnv_115"><span class="control" id="-vv0mnv_126">6. Popularity and community support</span></p><p id="-vv0mnv_116">It is worth looking closely at the popularity and community support of the programming language and associated technologies. It doesn&rsquo;t come down only to the number of users and libraries. Pay attention to how active and supportive the language&rsquo;s community is, including its users and contributors. Look for available blogs, podcasts, forums, and other resources.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="the-future-of-cross-platform-development" data-toc="the-future-of-cross-platform-development">The future of cross-platform development</h2><p id="-vv0mnv_127">As cross-platform development continues to evolve, we can expect even greater efficiency, performance, and flexibility from the tools and languages supporting it. With growing demand for seamless user experiences across multiple devices, more companies are investing in frameworks that allow developers to share code without compromising on native performance. The future of cross-platform technologies looks promising, with advances likely to reduce limitations and further streamline the development process for a wide range of applications.</p><p id="-vv0mnv_128"><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/" id="-vv0mnv_129" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer"><figure id="-vv0mnv_130"><img alt="See Kotlin Multiplatform in Action" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/see-kmp-in-action.svg" title="See Kotlin Multiplatform in Action" width="500" height="43"></figure></a></p></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 02 April 2025</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="kotlin-multiplatform-flutter.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Kotlin Multiplatform and Flutter: cross-platform development solutions</a><a href="choosing-web-target.html" class="navigation-links__next">Choose the right web target for a Kotlin Multiplatform project</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b454/app.js"></script></body></html>
