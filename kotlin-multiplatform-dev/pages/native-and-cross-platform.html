This is especially true if you want to target both Android and iOS audiences. It may be challenging to decide which mobile development approach will be the best for your particular project. To help you choose between cross-platform and native app development, we've created a list of six essential things to keep in mind.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="what-is-native-mobile-app-development" data-toc="what-is-native-mobile-app-development">What is native mobile app development?</h2><p id="kmpg1f_12">Native mobile development means that you build an application for a particular mobile operating system &ndash; in most cases Android or iOS. While working on native apps, developers use specific programming languages and tools.

Some cross-platform development frameworks like <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/" id="kmpg1f_85" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin Multiplatform</a> provide the benefits of building both cross-platform and native apps and remove the limitations that are commonly associated with the approach.</p><section class="chapter"><h4 id="1-cross-platform-apps-provide-poorer-performance-than-native-apps" data-toc="1-cross-platform-apps-provide-poorer-performance-than-native-apps">1. Cross-platform apps provide poorer performance than native apps.</h4><p id="kmpg1f_86">Poor performance was long considered to be one of the main disadvantages of multiplatform applications. However, the performance and quality of your product largely depend on the tools you use to build the app. The latest cross-platform frameworks provide all the tools necessary to develop apps with a native-like user experience.</p><p id="kmpg1f_87">By using different compiler backends, <a href="multiplatform-share-on-platforms.html" id="kmpg1f_88">Kotlin</a> is compiled to platform formats &ndash; JVM bytecode for Android and native binaries for iOS. As a result, the performance of your shared code is the same as if you write them natively.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="2-cross-platform-frameworks-are-unsafe" data-toc="2-cross-platform-frameworks-are-unsafe">2. Cross-platform frameworks are unsafe.</h4><p id="kmpg1f_89">There's a common misconception that native apps are much more secure and reliable.

Cross-platform apps don't have access to all native functions of mobile devices.</h4><p id="kmpg1f_91">It is true that not all cross-platform frameworks allow you to build apps with full access to the device's features. Nevertheless, some modern multiplatform technologies can help you overcome this challenge. For example, Kotlin Multiplatform gives easy access to Android and iOS SDKs. It provides a <a href="multiplatform-connect-to-apis.html" id="kmpg1f_92">Kotlin mechanism of expected and actual declarations</a> to help you access the device's capabilities and features.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="4-it-can-often-be-difficult-to-manage-cross-platform-projects" data-toc="4-it-can-often-be-difficult-to-manage-cross-platform-projects">4.

The type and purpose of your future app</h3><p id="kmpg1f_101">One of the first steps is understanding what app you will be building, including its features and purpose. A complex application with many features will require a lot of programming, especially if it's something new that doesn't have any existing templates.</p><p id="kmpg1f_102">How crucial is the user interface of your app? Are you looking for outstanding visuals or is the UI less important? Will it require any specific hardware functionality and access to camera and GPS location support? You need to make sure the mobile development approach you choose provides the necessary tools to build the app you need and provide a great user experience.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="2-your-team-s-experience-in-programming-languages-and-tools" data-toc="2-your-team-s-experience-in-programming-languages-and-tools">2. Your team's experience in programming languages and tools</h3><p id="kmpg1f_103">The developers on your team should have enough experience and expertise to work with particular frameworks. Pay close attention to what programming skills and languages the development tools require.</p><p id="kmpg1f_104">For example, developers need to know Objective-C or Swift to create native apps for iOS, and they need to know Kotlin or Java for Android. The cross-platform framework Flutter requires knowledge of Dart. If you use Kotlin Multiplatform, Kotlin syntax is easy for iOS developers to learn because it follows concepts similar to Swift.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="3-long-term-viability" data-toc="3-long-term-viability">3. Long-term viability</h3><p id="kmpg1f_105">When choosing between different approaches and frameworks, you need to be confident that the platform vendor will continue supporting it over the long term. You can dig into the details about the provider, the size of their community, and adoption by global companies. For example, Kotlin Multiplatform was developed by JetBrains, Flutter by Google, and React Native by Facebook.</p><p id="kmpg1f_106"><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/case-studies.html" id="kmpg1f_107" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer"><figure id="kmpg1f_108"><img alt="Explore real-world Kotlin Multiplatform use cases" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/kmp-use-cases-1.svg" title="Explore real-world Kotlin Multiplatform use cases" width="700" height="60"></figure></a></p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="4-development-cost-and-your-budget" data-toc="4-development-cost-and-your-budget">4.
