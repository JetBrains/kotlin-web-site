The archive contains settings for a TeamCity project.

To edit the settings in IntelliJ Idea, open the pom.xml and
select the 'Open as a project' option.

If you want to move this dsl to version control, save it in the
.teamcity directory.

## Branch specific settings
Bear in mind that not all the changes there will be applied. For instance, if you add a new project or a build configuration, such changes will be ignored. This happens because TeamCity does not support different sets of projects and build configurations in feature branches.
You can read more about it [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2018/01/branch-specific-settings-in-teamcity/).

## How to test a new project or a build configuration.
Considering described above, it is not possible to see a new project or build configuration until merging PR with DSL changes to the master branch.
To overcome this without merging, follow the next workaround.
Set your branch as a default one for the VCS root in versioned settings on the TeamCity configuration.
It is essential to keep your branch up to date with the master branch to avoid losing any configuration changes from it.
