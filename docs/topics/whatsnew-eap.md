## Kotlin K2 compiler updates

### Preview kapt compiler plugin with K2

> Support for K2 in the kapt compiler plugin is [Experimental](components-stability.md).
> Opt-in is required (see details below), and you should use it only for evaluation purposes.
>
{type="warning"}

In 1.9.20-RC, you can try using the [kapt compiler plugin](kapt.md) with the K2 compiler.
To use the K2 compiler in your project, add the following options to your `gradle.properties` file:

```text
kotlin.experimental.tryK2=true
kapt.use.k2=true
```

Alternatively, you can enable K2 for kapt by completing the following steps:
1. In your `build.gradle.kts` file, [set the language version](gradle-compiler-options.md#example-of-setting-a-languageversion) to `2.0`.
2. In your `gradle.properties` file, add `kapt.use.k2=true`.

If you encounter any issues when using kapt with the K2 compiler, please report them to our
[issue tracker](http://kotl.in/issue).

### How to enable the Kotlin K2 compiler

To enable and test the Kotlin K2 compiler, use the new language version with the following compiler option:

```bash
-language-version 2.0
```

You can specify it in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
kotlin {
   sourceSets.all {
       languageSettings {
           languageVersion = "2.0"
       }
   }
}
```

## How to update to Kotlin %kotlinEapVersion%

Install Kotlin %kotlinEapVersion% in any of the following ways:

* If you use the _Early Access Preview_ update channel, the IDE will suggest automatically updating to %kotlinEapVersion% as
  soon as it becomes available.
* If you use the _Stable_ update channel, you can change the channel to _Early Access Preview_ at any time by selecting
  **Tools** | **Kotlin** | **Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates** in your IDE. You'll then be able to install the latest
  preview release. Check out [these instructions](install-eap-plugin.md) for details.

Once you've installed %kotlinEapVersion% don't forget to [change the Kotlin version](configure-build-for-eap.md)
to %kotlinEapVersion% in your build scripts.
