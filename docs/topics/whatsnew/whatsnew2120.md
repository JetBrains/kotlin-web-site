## IDE support

The Kotlin plugins that support 2.1.20 are bundled in the latest IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio.
You don't need to update the Kotlin plugin in your IDE.
All you need to do is to change the Kotlin version to 2.1.20 in your build scripts.

See [Update to a new release](releases.md#update-to-a-new-kotlin-version) for details.

### Download sources for Kotlin artifacts in projects with OSGi support

Sources of all dependencies of the `kotlin-osgi-bundle` library are now included in its distribution. This allows
IntelliJ IDEA to download these sources to provide documentation for Kotlin symbols and improve the debugging experience.

## Kotlin K2 compiler

We're continuing to improve plugin support for the new Kotlin K2 compiler. This release brings updates to the new kapt
and Lombok plugins.

### New default kapt plugin
<primary-label ref="beta"/>

Starting with Kotlin 2.1.20, the K2 implementation of the kapt compiler plugin is enabled by default for all the projects.

The JetBrains team launched the new implementation of the kapt plugin with the K2 compiler back in Kotlin 1.9.20.
Since then, we have further developed the internal implementation of K2 kapt and made its behavior similar to that of the K1 version,
while significantly improving its performance as well.

If you encounter any issues when using kapt with the K2 compiler,
you can temporarily revert to the previous plugin implementation.

To do this, add the following option to the `gradle.properties` file of your project:

```kotlin
kapt.use.k2=false
```

Please report any issues to our [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71439/K2-kapt-feedback).

### Lombok compiler plugin: support for `@SuperBuilder` and updates on `@Builder`
<primary-label ref="experimental-general"/>

The [Kotlin Lombok compiler plugin](lombok.md) now supports the `@SuperBuilder` annotation, making it easier to create
builders for class hierarchies. Previously, developers using Lombok in Kotlin had to manually define builders when
working with inheritance. With `@SuperBuilder`, the builder automatically inherits superclass fields, allowing you to
initialize them when constructing an object.

Additionally, this update includes several improvements and bug fixes:

* The `@Builder` annotation now works on constructors, allowing more flexible object creation. For more details,
  see the corresponding [YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71547).
* Several issues related to Lombok's code generation in Kotlin have been resolved, improving overall compatibility.
  For more details, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.20).

For more information about the `@SuperBuilder` annotation, see the official [Lombok documentation](https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/SuperBuilder).

## Kotlin Multiplatform: new DSL to replace Gradle's Application plugin
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

Starting with Gradle 8.7, the [Application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html) plugin is
no longer compatible with the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin. Kotlin 2.1.20 introduces an Experimental
DSL to achieve similar functionality. The new `executable {}` block configures execution tasks and Gradle
[distributions](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/distribution_plugin.html#distribution_plugin) for JVM targets.

Before the `executable {}` block in your build script, add the following `@OptIn` annotation:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)
```

For example:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    jvm {
        @OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)
        binaries {
            // Configures a JavaExec task named "runJvm" and a Gradle distribution for the "main" compilation in this target
            executable {
                mainClass.set("foo.MainKt")
            }

            // Configures a JavaExec task named "runJvmAnother" and a Gradle distribution for the "main" compilation
            executable(KotlinCompilation.MAIN_COMPILATION_NAME, "another") {
                // Set a different class
                mainClass.set("foo.MainAnotherKt")
            }

            // Configures a JavaExec task named "runJvmTest" and a Gradle distribution for the "test" compilation
            executable(KotlinCompilation.TEST_COMPILATION_NAME) {
                mainClass.set("foo.MainTestKt")
            }

            // Configures a JavaExec task named "runJvmTestAnother" and a Gradle distribution for the "test" compilation
            executable(KotlinCompilation.TEST_COMPILATION_NAME, "another") {
                mainClass.set("foo.MainAnotherTestKt")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, Gradle's [Distribution](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/distribution_plugin.html#distribution_plugin)
plugin is applied on the first `executable {}` block.

If you run into any issues, report them in our [issue tracker](https://kotl.in/issue) or let us know in our [public Slack channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C19FD9681).

## Kotlin/Native: new inlining optimization
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

Kotlin 2.1.20 introduces a new inlining optimization pass, which comes before the actual code generation phase.

The new inlining pass in the Kotlin/Native compiler should perform better than the standard LLVM inliner and improve the
runtime performance of the generated code.

The new inlining pass is currently [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). To try it out,
use the following compiler option:

```none
-Xbinary=preCodegenInlineThreshold=40
```

Our experiments show that setting the threshold to 40 tokens (code units parsed by the compiler) provides a reasonable
compromise for compilation optimization. According to our benchmarks, this gives an overall performance improvement
of 9.5%. Of course, you can try out other values, too.

If you experience increased binary size or compilation time, please report such issues via [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

## Kotlin/Wasm

This release improves Kotlin/Wasm debugging and property usage. Custom formatters now work out of the box in development
builds, while DWARF debugging facilitates code inspection. Additionally, the Provider API simplifies property usage in
Kotlin/Wasm and Kotlin/JS.

### Custom formatters enabled by default

Before, you had to [manually configure](whatsnew21.md#improved-debugging-experience-for-kotlin-wasm) custom formatters
to improve debugging in web browsers when working with Kotlin/Wasm code.

In this release, custom formatters are enabled by default in development builds, so you don't need additional Gradle
configurations.

To use this feature, you only need to ensure that custom formatters are enabled in your browser's developer tools:

* In Chrome DevTools, find the custom formatters checkbox in **Settings | Preferences | Console**:

  ![Enable custom formatters in Chrome](wasm-custom-formatters-chrome.png){width=400}

* In Firefox DevTools, find the custom formatters checkbox in **Settings | Advanced settings**:

  ![Enable custom formatters in Firefox](wasm-custom-formatters-firefox.png){width=400}

This change primarily affects Kotlin/Wasm development builds. If you have specific requirements for production builds,
you need to adjust your Gradle configuration accordingly. To do so, add the following compiler option to the `wasmJs {}` block:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    wasmJs {
        // ...

        compilerOptions {
            freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwasm-debugger-custom-formatters")
        }
    }
}
```

### Support for DWARF to debug Kotlin/Wasm code

Kotlin 2.1.20 introduces support for DWARF (debugging with arbitrary record format) in Kotlin/Wasm.

With this change, the Kotlin/Wasm compiler is able to embed DWARF data into the generated WebAssembly (Wasm) binary.
Many debuggers and virtual machines can read this data to provide insights into the compiled code.

DWARF is mainly useful for debugging Kotlin/Wasm applications inside standalone Wasm virtual machines (VMs). To use this
feature, the Wasm VM and debugger must support DWARF.

With DWARF support, you can step through Kotlin/Wasm applications, inspect variables, and gain code insights. To enable
this feature, use the following compiler option:

```bash
-Xwasm-generate-dwarf
```
### Migration to Provider API for Kotlin/Wasm and Kotlin/JS properties

Previously, properties in Kotlin/Wasm and Kotlin/JS extensions were mutable (`var`) and assigned directly in build scripts:

```kotlin
the<NodeJsExtension>().version = "2.0.0"
```

Now, properties are exposed through the [Provider API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/properties_providers.html),
and you must use the `.set()` function to assign values:

```kotlin
the<NodeJsEnvSpec>().version.set("2.0.0")
```

The Provider API ensures that values are lazily computed and properly integrated with task dependencies, improving build
performance.

With this change, direct property assignments are deprecated in favor of `*EnvSpec` classes,
such as `NodeJsEnvSpec` and `YarnRootEnvSpec`.

Additionally, several alias tasks have been removed to avoid confusion:

| Deprecated task        | Replacement                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `wasmJsRun`            | `wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun`                                   |
| `wasmJsBrowserRun`     | `wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun`                                   |
| `wasmJsNodeRun`        | `wasmJsNodeDevelopmentRun`                                      |
| `wasmJsBrowserWebpack` | `wasmJsBrowserProductionWebpack` or `wasmJsBrowserDistribution` |
| `jsRun`                | `jsBrowserDevelopmentRun`                                       |
| `jsBrowserRun`         | `jsBrowserDevelopmentRun`                                       |
| `jsNodeRun`            | `jsNodeDevelopmentRun`                                          |
| `jsBrowserWebpack`     | `jsBrowserProductionWebpack` or `jsBrowserDistribution`         |

If you only use Kotlin/JS or Kotlin/Wasm in build scripts, no action is required as Gradle automatically handles assignments.

However, if you maintain a plugin based on the Kotlin Gradle Plugin, and your plugin does not apply `kotlin-dsl`,
you must update property assignments to use the `.set()` function.

## Gradle

Kotlin 2.1.20 is fully compatible with Gradle 7.6.3 through 8.11. You can also use Gradle versions up to the latest Gradle
release. However, be aware that doing so may result in deprecation warnings, and some new Gradle features might not work.

This version of Kotlin includes compatibility of Kotlin Gradle plugins with Gradle's Isolated Projects as well as support
for custom Gradle publication variants.

### Kotlin Gradle plugins compatible with Gradle's Isolated Projects
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

> This feature is currently in a pre-Alpha state in Gradle. JS and Wasm targets are not supported at the moment.
> Use it only with Gradle version 8.10 or higher and solely for evaluation purposes.
>
{style="warning"}

Since Kotlin 2.1.0, you've been able to [preview Gradle's Isolated Projects feature](whatsnew21.md#preview-gradle-s-isolated-projects-in-kotlin-multiplatform)
in your projects.

Previously, you had to configure the Kotlin Gradle plugin to make your project compatible with the Isolated Projects
feature before you could try it out. In Kotlin 2.1.20, this additional step is no longer necessary.

Now, to enable the Isolated Projects feature, you only need to [set the system property](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/isolated_projects.html#how_do_i_use_it).

Gradle's Isolated Projects feature is supported in Kotlin Gradle plugins for both multiplatform projects and projects
that contain only the JVM or Android target.

Specifically for multiplatform projects, if you notice problems with your Gradle build after upgrading, you can opt out
of the new Kotlin Gradle plugin behavior by adding:

```none
kotlin.kmp.isolated-projects.support=disable
```

However, if you use this Gradle property in your multiplatform project, you can't use the Isolated Projects feature.

Let us know about your experience with this feature in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-57279/Support-Gradle-Project-Isolation-Feature-for-Kotlin-Multiplatform).

### Support for adding custom Gradle publication variants
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

Kotlin 2.1.20 introduces support for adding custom [Gradle publication variants](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/variant_attributes.html).
This feature is available for multiplatform projects and projects targeting the JVM.

> You cannot modify existing Gradle variants with this feature.
>
{style="note"}

This feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
To opt in, use the `@OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)` annotation.

To add a custom Gradle publication variant, invoke the `adhocSoftwareComponent()` function, which returns an instance of
[`AdhocComponentWithVariants`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/component/AdhocComponentWithVariants.html)
that you can configure in the Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
plugins {
    // Only JVM and Multiplatform are supported
    kotlin("jvm")
    // or
    kotlin("multiplatform")
}


kotlin {
    @OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)
    publishing {
        // Returns an instance of AdhocSoftwareComponent
        adhocSoftwareComponent()
        // Alternatively, you can configure AdhocSoftwareComponent in the DSL block as follows
        adhocSoftwareComponent {
            // Add your custom variants here using the AdhocSoftwareComponent API
        }
    }
}
```

> For more information on variants, see Gradle's [Customizing publishing guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_customization.html).

{style="tip"}

## Standard library

This release brings new Experimental features to the standard library: common atomic types, improved support for UUIDs,
and new time-tracking functionality.

### Common atomic types
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

In Kotlin 2.1.20, we are introducing common atomic types in the standard library's `kotlin.concurrent.atomics`
package, enabling shared, platform-independent code for thread-safe operations. This simplifies development for Kotlin
Multiplatform projects by removing the need to duplicate atomic-dependent logic across source sets.

The `kotlin.concurrent.atomics` package and its properties are [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
To opt in, use the `@OptIn(ExperimentalAtomicApi::class)` annotation or the compiler option `-opt-in=kotlin.ExperimentalAtomicApi`.

Here's an example that shows how you can use `AtomicInt` to safely count processed items across multiple threads:

```kotlin
// Imports the necessary libraries
import kotlin.concurrent.atomics.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

//sampleStart
@OptIn(ExperimentalAtomicApi::class)
suspend fun main() {
    // Initializes the atomic counter for processed items
    var processedItems = AtomicInt(0)
    val totalItems = 100
    val items = List(totalItems) { "item$it" }
    // Splits the items into chunks for processing by multiple coroutines
    val chunkSize = 20
    val itemChunks = items.chunked(chunkSize)
    coroutineScope {
        for (chunk in itemChunks) {
            launch {
                for (item in chunk) {
                    println("Processing $item in thread ${Thread.currentThread()}")
                    processedItems += 1 // Increment counter atomically
                }
            }
         }
    }
//sampleEnd
    // Prints the total number of processed items
    println("Total processed items: ${processedItems.load()}")
}
```
{validate="false" kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.1.20"}

To enable seamless interoperability between Kotlin's atomic types and Java's [`java.util.concurrent.atomic`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html)
atomic types, the API provides the `.asJavaAtomic()` and `.asKotlinAtomic()` extension functions. On the JVM, Kotlin
atomics and Java atomics are the same types in runtime, so you can transform Java atomics into Kotlin atomics and vice
versa without any overhead.

Here's an example that shows how Kotlin and Java atomic types can work together:

```kotlin
// Imports the necessary libraries
import kotlin.concurrent.atomics.*
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.*

//sampleStart
@OptIn(ExperimentalAtomicApi::class)
fun main() {
    // Converts Kotlin AtomicInt to Java's AtomicInteger
    val kotlinAtomic = AtomicInt(42)
    val javaAtomic: AtomicInteger = kotlinAtomic.asJavaAtomic()
    println("Java atomic value: ${javaAtomic.get()}")
    // Java atomic value: 42

    // Converts Java's AtomicInteger back to Kotlin's AtomicInt
    val kotlinAgain: AtomicInt = javaAtomic.asKotlinAtomic()
    println("Kotlin atomic value: ${kotlinAgain.load()}")
    // Kotlin atomic value: 42
}
//sampleEnd
```
{validate="false" kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.1.20"}

### Changes in UUID parsing, formatting, and comparability
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

The JetBrains team continues to improve the support for UUIDs [introduced to the standard library in 2.0.20](whatsnew2020.md#support-for-uuids-in-the-common-kotlin-standard-library).

Previously, the `parse()` function only accepted UUIDs in the hex-and-dash format. With Kotlin 2.1.20,
you can use `parse()` for _both_ the hex-and-dash and the plain hexadecimal (without dashes) formats.

We've also introduced functions specific to operations with the hex-and-dash format in this release:

* `parseHexDash()` parses UUIDs from the hex-and-dash format.
* `toHexDashString()` converts a `Uuid` into a `String` in the hex-and-dash format (mirroring the functionality of `toString()`).

These functions work similarly to [`parseHex()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.uuid/-uuid/-companion/parse-hex.html)
and [`toHexString()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.uuid/-uuid/to-hex-string.html), which were
introduced earlier for the hexadecimal format. Explicit naming for parsing and formatting functionality should improve
code clarity and your overall experience with UUIDs.

UUIDs in Kotlin are now `Comparable`. Starting with Kotlin 2.1.20, you can directly compare and sort values of the `Uuid`
type. This enables the use of the `<` and `>` operators and standard library extensions available exclusively for
`Comparable` types or their collections (such as `sorted()`), and it also allows passing UUIDs to any functions or APIs
that require the `Comparable` interface.

Remember that the UUID support in the standard library is still [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
To opt in, use the `@OptIn(ExperimentalUuidApi::class)` annotation or the compiler option `-opt-in=kotlin.uuid.ExperimentalUuidApi`:

```kotlin
import kotlin.uuid.ExperimentalUuidApi
import kotlin.uuid.Uuid

//sampleStart
@OptIn(ExperimentalUuidApi::class)
fun main() {
    // parse() accepts a UUID in a plain hexadecimal format
    val uuid = Uuid.parse("550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000")

    // Converts it to the hex-and-dash format
    val hexDashFormat = uuid.toHexDashString()
 
    // Outputs the UUID in the hex-and-dash format
    println(hexDashFormat)

    // Outputs UUIDs in ascending order
    println(
        listOf(
            uuid,
            Uuid.parse("780e8400e29b41d4a716446655440005"),
            Uuid.parse("5ab88400e29b41d4a716446655440076")
        ).sorted()
    )
   }
//sampleEnd
```
{validate="false" kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.1.20"}

### New time tracking functionality
<primary-label ref="experimental-opt-in"/>

Starting with Kotlin 2.1.20, the standard library provides the ability to represent a moment in time. This functionality
was previously only available in [`kotlinx-datetime`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx-datetime/), an official Kotlin
library.

The [`kotlinx.datetime.Clock`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx-datetime/kotlinx-datetime/kotlinx.datetime/-clock/) interface
is introduced to the standard library as `kotlin.time.Clock` and the [`kotlinx.datetime.Instant`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx-datetime/kotlinx-datetime/kotlinx.datetime/-instant/)
class as `kotlin.time.Instant`. These concepts naturally align with the `time` package in the standard library because
they're only concerned with moments in time compared to a more complex calendar and timezone functionality that remains
in `kotlinx-datetime`.

`Instant` and `Clock` are useful when you need precise time tracking without considering time zones or dates. For example,
you can use them to log events with timestamps, measure durations between two points in time, and obtain the current
moment for system processes.

To provide interoperability with other languages, additional converter functions are available:

* `.toKotlinInstant()` converts a time value to a `kotlin.time.Instant` instance.
* `.toJavaInstant()` converts the `kotlin.time.Instant` value to a `java.time.Instant` value.
* `Instant.toJSDate()` converts the `kotlin.time.Instant` value to an instance of the JS `Date` class. This conversion
  is not precise; JS uses millisecond precision to represent dates, while Kotlin allows for nanosecond resolution.

The new time features of the standard library are still [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
To opt in, use the `@OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)` annotation:

```kotlin
import kotlin.time.*

@OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)
fun main() {

    // Get the current moment in time
    val currentInstant = Clock.System.now()
    println("Current time: $currentInstant")

    // Find the difference between two moments in time
    val pastInstant = Instant.parse("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")
    val duration = currentInstant - pastInstant

    println("Time elapsed since 2023-01-01: $duration")
}
```
{validate="false" kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.1.20"}

For more information on the implementation, see this [KEEP proposal](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pull/387/files).

## Compose compiler

In 2.1.20, the Compose compiler relaxes some restrictions on `@Composable` functions introduced in previous releases.
In addition, the Compose compiler Gradle plugin is set to include source information by default, aligning the behavior
on all platforms with Android.

### Support for default arguments in open `@Composable` functions

The compiler previously restricted default arguments in open `@Composable` functions due to incorrect compiler output,
which would result in crashes at runtime. The underlying issue is now resolved, and default arguments are fully supported
when used with Kotlin 2.1.20 or newer.

Compose compiler allowed default arguments in open functions before [version 1.5.8](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-compiler#1.5.8),
so the support depends on project configuration:

* If an open composable function is compiled with Kotlin version 2.1.20 or newer, the compiler generates correct wrappers
  for default arguments. This includes wrappers compatible with pre-1.5.8 binaries, meaning that downstream libraries
  will also be able to use this open function.
* If the open composable function is compiled with Kotlin older than 2.1.20, Compose uses a compatibility mode, which
  might result in runtime crashes. When using the compatibility mode, the compiler emits a warning to highlight potential
  problems.

### Final overridden functions are allowed to be restartable

Virtual functions (overrides of `open` and `abstract`, including interfaces) [were forced to be non-restartable with the 2.1.0 release](whatsnew21.md#changes-to-open-and-overridden-composable-functions).
This restriction is now relaxed for functions that are members of final classes or are `final` themselves – they will
be restarted or skipped as usual.

You might observe some behavior changes in affected functions after upgrading to Kotlin 2.1.20. To force non-restartable
logic from the previous version, apply the `@NonRestartableComposable` annotation to the function.

### `ComposableSingletons` removed from public API

`ComposableSingletons` is a class created by the Compose compiler when optimizing `@Composable` lambdas. Lambdas that
do not capture any parameters are allocated once and cached in a property of the class, saving allocations during runtime.
The class is generated with internal visibility and is only intended for optimizing lambdas inside a compilation unit
(usually a file).

However, this optimization was also applied to `inline` function bodies, which resulted in singleton lambda instances
leaking into the public API. To fix this problem, starting with 2.1.20, `@Composable` lambdas are no longer optimized
into singletons inside inline functions. At the same time, the Compose compiler will continue generating singleton classes
and lambdas for inline functions to support binary compatibility for modules that were compiled under the previous model.

### Source information included by default

The Compose compiler Gradle plugin already has the [including source information](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlin-gradle-plugin/compose-compiler-gradle-plugin/org.jetbrains.kotlin.compose.compiler.gradle/-compose-compiler-gradle-plugin-extension/include-source-information.html)
feature enabled by default on Android. Starting with Kotlin 2.1.20, this feature will be enabled by default on all platforms.

Remember to check if you set this option using `freeCompilerArgs`. This method can cause the build to fail when used
alongside the plugin, due to an option being effectively set twice.

## Breaking changes and deprecations

* To align Kotlin Multiplatform with upcoming changes in Gradle, we are phasing out the `withJava()` function.
  [Java source sets are now created by default](multiplatform-compatibility-guide.md#java-source-sets-created-by-default).

* The JetBrains team is proceeding with the deprecation of the `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin. If you try to use it
  in your project, you'll now get a configuration error, and no plugin code will be executed.

* The legacy `kotlin.incremental.classpath.snapshot.enabled` property has been removed from the Kotlin Gradle plugin.
  The property used to provide an opportunity to fall back to a built-in ABI snapshot on the JVM. The plugin now uses
  other methods to detect and avoid unnecessary recompilations, making the property obsolete.

## Documentation updates

The Kotlin documentation has received some notable changes:

### Revamped and new pages

* [Kotlin roadmap](roadmap.md) – see the updated list of Kotlin's priorities on language and ecosystem evolution.
* [Gradle best practices](gradle-best-practices.md) page – learn essential best practices for optimizing your Gradle

## How to update to Kotlin 2.1.20

Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3 and Android Studio Iguana (2023.2.1) Canary 15, the Kotlin plugin is distributed as a
bundled plugin included in your IDE. This means that you can't install the plugin from JetBrains Marketplace anymore.

To update to the new Kotlin version, [change the Kotlin version](releases.md#update-to-a-new-kotlin-version)
to 2.1.20 in your build scripts.
