With many options available, it can be challenging to pick the one that will best suit your needs. To help you find the right tool, we've put together a list of the six best cross-platform app development frameworks and the features that make them great. At the end of this article, you will also find a few key things to pay attention to when choosing a multiplatform development framework for your business.

## What is a cross-platform app development framework?

Mobile engineers use cross-platform mobile development frameworks to build native-looking applications for multiple platforms, such as Android and iOS, using a single codebase. Shareable code is one of the key advantages this approach has over native app development. Having one single codebase means that mobile engineers can save time by avoiding the need to write code for each operating system, accelerating the development process.

## Popular cross-platform app development frameworks

This list is not exhaustive; many other options are available on the market today. The important thing to realize is that there's no one-size-fits-all tool that will be ideal for everyone. The choice of framework largely depends on your particular project and your goals, as well as other specifics that we will cover at the end of the article.

Nevertheless, we've tried to pick out some of the best frameworks for cross-platform mobile development to give you a starting point for your decision.
