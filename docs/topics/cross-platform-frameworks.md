## How do you choose the right cross-platform app development framework for your project?

There are other cross-platform frameworks besides those mentioned above, and new tools will continue to appear on the market. Given the wide array of options, how can you find the right one for your next project? The first step is to understand your project's requirements and goals, and to get a clear idea of what you want your future app to look like. Next, you'll want to take the following important factors into account so you can decide on the best fit for your business.

#### 1. The expertise of your team

Different cross-platform mobile development frameworks are based on different programming languages. Before adopting a framework, check what skills it requires and make sure your team of mobile engineers has enough knowledge and experience to work with it.

For example, if your team is equipped with highly skilled JavaScript developers, and you don't have enough resources to introduce new technologies, it may be worth choosing frameworks that use this language, such as React Native.

#### 2. Vendor reliability and support

It's important to be sure that the maintainer of the framework will continue to support it in the long run. Learn more about the companies that develop and support the frameworks you're considering, and take a look at the mobile apps that have been built using them.

#### 3. UI customization

Depending on how crucial the user interface is for your future app, you may need to know how easily you can customize the UI using a particular framework. For example, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile provides you with full control over the UI and the ability to use the latest UI frameworks, such as SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

#### 4. Framework maturity

Find out how frequently the public API and tooling for a prospective framework changes. For example, some changes to native operating system components break internal cross-platform behavior. It's better to be aware of possible challenges you may face when working with the mobile app development framework. You can also browse GitHub and check how many bugs the framework has and how these bugs are being handled.

#### 5. Framework capabilities

Each framework has its own capabilities and limitations. Knowing what features and tools a framework provides is crucial to identifying the best solution for you. Does it have code analyzers and unit testing frameworks? How quickly and easily will you be able to build, debug, and test your app?

#### 6. Consistency between different platforms

Providing consistency between multiple platforms can be challenging, given how much platforms like Android and iOS significantly differ, particularly in terms of the development experience. For example, tools and libraries aren't the same on these operating systems, so there may be many differences when it comes to the business logic. Some technologies, like Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, allow you to write and share the app's business logic between Android and iOS platforms.

#### 7. Security

Security and privacy are especially important when building a critical mobile app for business, for example, banking and e-commerce apps that include a payment system. According to [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/), among the most critical security risks for mobile applications are insecure data storage, authentication, and authorization.

You need to ensure that the multiplatform mobile development framework of your choice provides the required level of security. One way to do this is to browse the security tickets on the framework's issue tracker if it has one that's publicly available.

#### 8. Educational materials

The volume and quality of available learning resources about a framework can also help you understand how smooth your experience will be when working with it. Comprehensive official [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html), online and offline conferences, and educational courses are a good sign that you will be able to find enough essential information about a product when you need it.

## Key takeaways

Without considering these factors, it's difficult to choose the framework for cross-platform mobile development that will best meet your specific needs. Take a closer look at your future application requirements and weigh them against capabilities of various frameworks. Doing so will allow you to find the right cross-platform solution to help you deliver high-quality apps.
