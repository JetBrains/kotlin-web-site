[//]: # (title: Kotlin command-line compiler)

Every release ships with a standalone version of the compiler. You can download the latest version (`kotlin-compiler-%kotlinVersion%.zip`)
from [GitHub Releases](%kotlinLatestUrl%).

## Install the compiler

### Manual install

Unzip the standalone compiler into a directory and optionally add the `bin` directory to the system path.
The `bin` directory contains the scripts needed to compile and run Kotlin on Windows, OS X and Linux.

### SDKMAN!

An easier way to install Kotlin on UNIX-based systems such as OS X, Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, and Solaris is
[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io). It also works in Bash and ZSH shells. [Learn how to install SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/install).

To install the Kotlin compiler via SDKMAN!, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
$ sdk install kotlin
```

### Homebrew

Alternatively, on OS X you can install the compiler via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install kotlin
```

### Snap package

If you use [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, you can install the compiler from the command line:

```bash
$ sudo snap install --classic kotlin
```

## Create and run an application

1. Create a simple application in Kotlin that displays `"Hello, World!"`. In your favorite editor, create a new file called
`hello.kt` with the following lines:

   ```kotlin
   fun main() {
       println("Hello, World!")
   }
   ```

2. Compile the application using the Kotlin compiler:

   ```bash
   $ kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar
   ```

   The `-d` option indicates the output path for generated class files, which may be either a directory or a *.jar* file.
   The `-include-runtime` option makes the resulting *.jar* file self-contained and runnable by including the Kotlin runtime
library in it.

   To see all available options, run

   ```bash
   $ kotlinc -help
   ```

3. Run the application.

   ```bash
   $ java -jar hello.jar
   ```

## Compile a library

If you're developing a library to be used by other Kotlin applications, you can build the *.jar* file without including
the Kotlin runtime into it.

```bash
$ kotlinc hello.kt -d hello.jar
```

Since binaries compiled this way depend on the Kotlin runtime you should make sure the latter is present in the classpath
whenever your compiled library is used.

You can also use the `kotlin` script to run binaries produced by the Kotlin compiler:

```bash
$ kotlin -classpath hello.jar HelloKt
```

`HelloKt` is the main class name that the Kotlin compiler generates for the file named `hello.kt`.

## Run the REPL

You can run the compiler without parameters to have an interactive shell. In this shell, you can type any valid Kotlin code
and see the results.

## Run scripts

Kotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (`.kts`) with top-level executable code.

```kotlin
import java.io.File

// Get the passed in path, i.e. "-d some/path" or use the current path.
val path = if (args.contains("-d")) args[1 + args.indexOf("-d")]
           else "."

val folders = File(path).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() }
folders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) }
```

To run a script, we just pass the `-script` option to the compiler with the corresponding script file.

```bash
$ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts -- -d <path_to_folder_to_inspect>
```

Since 1.3.0, Kotlin has an experimental support for scripts customization, such as adding external properties, 
providing static or dynamic dependencies, and so on. Customizations are defined by so-called *Script definitions* - 
annotated kotlin classes with appropriate support code. The script filename extension is used to select appropriate
definition.

Properly prepared script definitions are detected and applied automatically when the appropriate jars are included
in the compilation classpath. Alternatively, you can specify definitions manually using `-script-templates` option to the compiler:

```bash
$ kotlinc -script-templates org.example.CustomScriptDefinition -script custom.script1.kts
```
