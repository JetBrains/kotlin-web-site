[//]: # (title: Advent of Code puzzles in idiomatic Kotlin)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of Christmas-themed puzzles that follow an Advent calendar,
where a new puzzle is released each day. With the permission of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), creator of Advent of Code,
we’ll show how to solve these puzzles using the idiomatic Kotlin style.

> You can find all the solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 puzzles in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-2020/).

## Day 1: Report repair

In this puzzle, you'll explore input handling, iterating over a list, different ways of building a map, and using
the [`let`](scope-functions.md#let) function to simplify your code.

## Day 2: Password philosophy

In this puzzle, you'll explore string utility functions, regular expressions, operations on collections,
and how the [`let`](scope-functions.md#let) function can be helpful to transform your expressions.

## Day 3: Toboggan trajectory

In this puzzle, you'll compare imperative and more functional code styles, work with pairs and the [`reduce()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/reduce.html)
function, edit code in the column selection mode, and fix integer overflows.

## Day 4: Passport processing

In this puzzle, you'll apply the [`when`](control-flow.md#when-expression) statement and explore different ways of
how to validate the input: utility functions, working ranges, checking set membership, and matching a particular regular
expression.

## Day 5: Binary boarding

In this puzzle, you'll use the Kotlin standard library functions (`replace()`, `toInt`, `find`) to work with the binary representation of numbers,
explore powerful local functions, and learn how to use the `max()` function in Kotlin 1.5 correctly.

## Day 6: Custom customs

In this puzzle, you'll learn how to group and count characters in strings and collections using the standard library
functions: `map()`, `reduce()`, `sumOf()`, `intersect()`, and `union()`.
