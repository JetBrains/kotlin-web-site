With Kotlin, you can intermix imperative, functional, and object-oriented styles of programming and benefit from the approach 
that’s most suitable for the problem at hand. 

Learn to use the many features of this highly concise, fluent, elegant, and expressive statically typed language with easy-to-understand examples. 

Learn to write maintainable, high-performing JVM and Android applications, create DSLs, program asynchronously, and much more.

[The Joy of Kotlin](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-kotlin) teaches you the right way to code in Kotlin. 

In this insight-rich book, you'll master the Kotlin language while exploring coding techniques that will make you 
a better developer no matter what language you use. Kotlin natively supports a functional style of programming, 
so seasoned author Pierre-Yves Saumont begins by reviewing the FP principles of immutability, referential transparency, 
and the separation between functions and effects. 

Then, you'll move deeper into using Kotlin in the real world, as you learn to handle errors and data properly, 
encapsulate shared state mutations, and work with laziness. 

This book will change the way you code — and give you back some of the joy you had when you first started.
