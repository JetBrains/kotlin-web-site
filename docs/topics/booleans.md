[//]: # (title: Booleans)

The type `Boolean` represents boolean objects that can have two values: `true` and `false`.
`Boolean` has a [nullable](null-safety.md) counterpart declared as `Boolean?`.

> On the JVM, booleans stored as the primitive `boolean` type typically use 8 bits.

Built-in operations on booleans include:

* `||` – disjunction (logical _OR_)
* `&&` – conjunction (logical _AND_)
* `!` – negation (logical _NOT_)

For example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val myTrue: Boolean = true
    val myFalse: Boolean = false
    val boolNull: Boolean? = null

    println(myTrue || myFalse)
    // true
    println(myTrue && myFalse)
    // false
    println(!myTrue)
    // false
    println(boolNull)
    // null
//sampleEnd
}
```

The `||` and `&&` operators work lazily, which means:

* If the first operand is `true`, the `||` operator does not evaluate the second operand.
* If the first operand is `false`, the `&&` operator does not evaluate the second operand.

> On the JVM, nullable references to boolean objects are boxed in Java classes, just like with [numbers](numbers.md#numbers-representation-on-the-jvm).
