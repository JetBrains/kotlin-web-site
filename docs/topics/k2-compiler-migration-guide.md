[//]: # (title: K2 compiler migration guide)

As the Kotlin language and ecosystem have continued to evolve, so has the Kotlin compiler. The first step was the
introduction of the new JVM and JS IR (Intermediate Representation) backends that share logic, simplifying code generation
for targets on different platforms. Now, the next stage of its evolution brings a new frontend known as K2.

![Kotlin K2 compiler architecture](k2-compiler-architecture.svg){width=700}

With the arrival of the K2 compiler, the Kotlin frontend has been completely rewritten and features a new,
more efficient architecture. The fundamental change the new compiler brings is the use of one unified data structure that
contains more semantic information. This frontend is responsible for performing semantic analysis, call resolution,
and type inference.

The new architecture and enriched data structure enables the K2 compiler to provide the following benefits:

* **Improved call resolution and type inference**. The compiler behaves more consistently and understands your code better.
* **Easier introduction of syntactic sugar for new language features**. In the future, you'll be able to use more concise,
  readable code when new features are introduced.
* **Faster compilation times**. Compilation times can be [significantly faster](#performance-improvements).
* **Enhanced IDE performance**. If you enable K2 Kotlin mode in IntelliJ IDEA, then IntelliJ IDEA will use the K2 compiler
  frontend to analyze your Kotlin code, bringing stability and performance improvements. For more information,
  see [Support in IDEs](#support-in-ides).

## Performance improvements

To evaluate the performance of the K2 compiler, we ran performance tests on two open-source projects: [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)
and [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed). Here are the key performance improvements that we found:

* The K2 compiler brings up to 94% compilation speed gains. For example, in the Anki-Android project, clean build times
  were reduced from 57.7 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to 29.7 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.
* The initialization phase is up to 488% faster with the K2 compiler. For example, in the Anki-Android project, the
  initialization phase for incremental builds was cut from 0.126 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to just 0.022 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.
* The Kotlin K2 compiler is up to 376% quicker in the analysis phase compared to the previous compiler. For example,
  in the Anki-Android project, analysis times for incremental builds were slashed from 0.581 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to
  only 0.122 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.

For more details on these improvements and to learn more about how we analyzed the performance of the K2 compiler, see our
[blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/04/k2-compiler-performance-benchmarks-and-how-to-measure-them-on-your-projects/).

## Language feature improvements

The Kotlin K2 compiler improves language features related to [smart-casting](#smart-casts) and [Kotlin Multiplatform](#kotlin-multiplatform).

### Smart casts

The Kotlin compiler can automatically cast an object to a type in specific cases,
saving you the trouble of having to explicitly specify it yourself. This is called [smart-casting](typecasts.md#smart-casts).
The Kotlin K2 compiler now performs smart casts in even more scenarios than before.

In Kotlin 2.0.0, we've made improvements related to smart casts in the following areas:

* [Local variables and further scopes](#local-variables-and-further-scopes)
* [Type checks with the logical `or` operator](#type-checks-with-the-logical-or-operator)
* [Inline functions](#inline-functions)
* [Properties with function types](#properties-with-function-types)
* [Exception handling](#exception-handling)
* [Increment and decrement operators](#increment-and-decrement-operators)

#### Local variables and further scopes

Previously, if a variable was evaluated as not `null` within an `if` condition, the variable would be smart-cast.
Information about this variable would then be shared further within the scope of the `if` block.

However, if you declared the variable **outside** the `if` condition, no information about the variable would be available
within the `if` condition, so it couldn't be smart-cast. This behavior was also seen with `when` expressions and `while` loops.

From Kotlin 2.0.0, if you declare a variable before using it in your `if`, `when`, or `while` condition, then any
information collected by the compiler about the variable will be accessible in the corresponding block for
smart-casting.

This can be useful when you want to do things like extract boolean conditions into variables. Then, you can give the
variable a meaningful name, which will improve your code readability and make it possible to reuse the variable later
in your code. For example:

```kotlin
class Cat {
    fun purr() {
        println("Purr purr")
    }
}

fun petAnimal(animal: Any) {
    val isCat = animal is Cat
    if (isCat) {
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler can access
        // information about isCat, so it knows that
        // animal was smart-cast to the type Cat.
        // Therefore, the purr() function can be called.
        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, the compiler doesn't know
        // about the smart cast, so calling the purr()
        // function triggers an error.
        animal.purr()
    }
}

fun main(){
    val kitty = Cat()
    petAnimal(kitty)
    // Purr purr
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.0" id="kotlin-smart-casts-k2-local-variables" validate="false"}

#### Type checks with the logical `or` operator

In Kotlin 2.0.0, if you combine type checks for objects with an `or` operator (`||`), a smart cast
is made to their closest common supertype. Before this change, a smart cast was always made to the `Any` type.

In this case, you still had to manually check the object type afterward before you could access any of its properties or
call its functions. For example:

```kotlin
interface Status {
    fun signal() {}
}

interface Ok : Status
interface Postponed : Status
interface Declined : Status

fun signalCheck(signalStatus: Any) {
    if (signalStatus is Postponed || signalStatus is Declined) {
        // signalStatus is smart-cast to a common supertype Status
        signalStatus.signal()
        // Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, signalStatus is smart cast 
        // to type Any, so calling the signal() function triggered an
        // Unresolved reference error. The signal() function can only 
        // be called successfully after another type check:
        
        // check(signalStatus is Status)
        // signalStatus.signal()
    }
}
```

> The common supertype is an **approximation** of a [union type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type). Union types
> are [not currently supported in Kotlin](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-13108/Denotable-union-and-intersection-types).
>
{type="note"}

#### Inline functions

In Kotlin 2.0.0, the K2 compiler treats inline functions differently,
allowing it to determine in combination with other compiler analyses whether it's safe to smart-cast.

Specifically, inline functions are now treated as having an implicit [`callsInPlace`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.contracts/-contract-builder/calls-in-place.html)
contract. This means that any lambda functions passed to an inline function are called in place. Since lambda functions
are called in place, the compiler knows that a lambda function can't leak references to any variables contained within
its function body.

The compiler uses this knowledge along with other compiler analyses to decide whether it's safe to smart-cast any of the
captured variables. For example:

```kotlin
interface Processor {
    fun process()
}

inline fun inlineAction(f: () -> Unit) = f()

fun nextProcessor(): Processor? = null

fun runProcessor(): Processor? {
    var processor: Processor? = null
    inlineAction {
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows that processor 
        // is a local variable and inlineAction() is an inline function, so 
        // references to processor can't be leaked. Therefore, it's safe 
        // to smart-cast processor.
      
        // If processor isn't null, processor is smart-cast
        if (processor != null) {
            // The compiler knows that processor isn't null, so no safe call 
            // is needed
            processor.process()

            // In Kotlin 1.9.20, you have to perform a safe call:
            // processor?.process()
        }

        processor = nextProcessor()
    }

    return processor
}
```

#### Properties with function types

In previous versions of Kotlin, there was a bug that meant that class properties with a function type weren't smart-cast.
We fixed this behavior in Kotlin 2.0.0 and the K2 compiler. For example:

```kotlin
class Holder(val provider: (() -> Unit)?) {
    fun process() {
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, if provider isn't null,
        // it is smart-cast
        if (provider != null) {
            // The compiler knows that provider isn't null
            provider()

            // In 1.9.20, the compiler doesn't know that provider isn't 
            // null, so it triggers an error:
            // Reference has a nullable type '(() -> Unit)?', use explicit '?.invoke()' to make a function-like call instead
        }
    }
}
```

This change also applies if you overload your `invoke` operator. For example:

```kotlin
interface Provider {
    operator fun invoke()
}

interface Processor : () -> String

class Holder(val provider: Provider?, val processor: Processor?) {
    fun process() {
        if (provider != null) {
            provider() 
            // In 1.9.20, the compiler triggers an error: 
            // Reference has a nullable type 'Provider?', use explicit '?.invoke()' to make a function-like call instead
        }
    }
}
```

#### Exception handling

In Kotlin 2.0.0, we've made improvements to exception handling so that smart cast information can be passed
on to `catch` and `finally` blocks. This change makes your code safer as the compiler keeps track of whether
your object has a nullable type. For example:

```kotlin
//sampleStart
fun testString() {
    var stringInput: String? = null
    // stringInput is smart-cast to String type
    stringInput = ""
    try {
        // The compiler knows that stringInput isn't null
        println(stringInput.length)
        // 0

        // The compiler rejects previous smart cast information for 
        // stringInput. Now stringInput has the String? type.
        stringInput = null

        // Trigger an exception
        if (2 > 1) throw Exception()
        stringInput = ""
    } catch (exception: Exception) {
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows stringInput 
        // can be null, so stringInput stays nullable.
        println(stringInput?.length)
        // null

        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, the compiler says that a safe call isn't
        // needed, but this is incorrect.
    }
}
//sampleEnd
fun main() {
    testString()
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.0" id="kotlin-smart-casts-k2-exception-handling"}

#### Increment and decrement operators

Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler didn't understand that the type of an object can change after using
an increment or decrement operator. As the compiler couldn't accurately track the object type,
your code could lead to unresolved reference errors. In Kotlin 2.0.0, this has been fixed:

```kotlin
interface Rho {
    operator fun inc(): Sigma = TODO()
}

interface Sigma : Rho {
    fun sigma() = Unit
}

interface Tau {
    fun tau() = Unit
}

fun main(input: Rho) {
    var unknownObject: Rho = input

    // Check if unknownObject inherits from the Tau interface
    // Note, it's possible that unknownObject inherits from both
    // Rho and Tau interfaces.
    if (unknownObject is Tau) {

        // Use the overloaded inc() operator from interface Rho.
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the type of unknownObject is smart-cast to
        // Sigma.
        ++unknownObject

        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows unknownObject has type
        // Sigma, so the sigma() function can be called successfully.
        unknownObject.sigma()

        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, the compiler doesn't perform a smart cast
        // when inc() is called so the compiler still thinks that 
        // unknownObject has type Tau. Calling the sigma() function 
        // throws a compile-time error.
        
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows unknownObject has type
        // Sigma, so calling the tau() function throws a compile-time 
        // error.
        unknownObject.tau()
        // Unresolved reference 'tau'

        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, since the compiler mistakenly thinks that 
        // unknownObject has type Tau, the tau() function can be called,
        // but it throws a ClassCastException.
    }
}
```

### Kotlin Multiplatform

There are improvements in the K2 compiler related to Kotlin Multiplatform in the following areas:

* [Separation of common and platform sources during compilation](#separation-of-common-and-platform-sources-during-compilation)
* [Different visibility levels of expected and actual declarations](#different-visibility-levels-of-expected-and-actual-declarations)

#### Separation of common and platform sources during compilation

Previously, the design of the Kotlin compiler prevented it from keeping common and platform source sets separate
at compile time. As a consequence, common code could access platform code, which resulted in different behavior
between platforms. In addition, some compiler settings and dependencies from common code used to leak into platform code.

In Kotlin 2.0.0, our implementation of the new Kotlin K2 compiler included a redesign of the compilation scheme to ensure
strict separation between common and platform source sets. This change is most noticeable when you use [expected and actual functions](multiplatform-expect-actual.md#expected-and-actual-functions).
Previously, it was possible for a function call in your common code to resolve to a function in platform code. For example:

<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Common code</td>
       <td>Platform code</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
fun foo(x: Any) = println("common foo")

fun exampleFunction() {
    foo(42)
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
// JVM
fun foo(x: Int) = println("platform foo")

// JavaScript
// There is no foo() function overload on the JavaScript platform
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

In this example, the common code has different behavior depending on which platform it is run on:

* On the JVM platform, calling the `foo()` function in the common code results in the `foo()` function from the platform code
  being called as `platform foo`.
* On the JavaScript platform, calling the `foo()` function in the common code results in the `foo()` function from the
  common code being called as `common foo`, as there is no such function available in the platform code.

In Kotlin 2.0.0, common code doesn't have access to platform code, so both platforms successfully resolve the `foo()`
function to the `foo()` function in the common code: `common foo`.

In addition to the improved consistency of behavior across platforms, we also worked hard to fix cases where there was
conflicting behavior between IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio and the compiler. For instance, when you used [expected and actual classes](multiplatform-expect-actual.md#expected-and-actual-classes),
the following would happen:

<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Common code</td>
       <td>Platform code</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
expect class Identity {
    fun confirmIdentity(): String
}

fun common() {
    // Before 2.0.0, it triggers an IDE-only error
    Identity().confirmIdentity()
    // RESOLUTION_TO_CLASSIFIER : Expected class Identity has no default constructor.
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
actual class Identity {
    actual fun confirmIdentity() = "expect class fun: jvm"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

In this example, the expected class `Identity` has no default constructor, so it can't be called successfully in common code.
Previously, an error was only reported by the IDE, but the code still compiled successfully on the JVM. However, now the
compiler correctly reports an error:

```none
Expected class 'expect class Identity : Any' does not have default constructor
```

##### When resolution behavior doesn't change

We're still in the process of migrating to the new compilation scheme, so the resolution behavior is still the same when
you call functions that aren't within the same source set. You'll notice this difference mainly when you use overloads
from a multiplatform library in your common code.

Suppose you have a library, which has two `whichFun()` functions with different signatures:

```kotlin
// Example library

// MODULE: common
fun whichFun(x: Any) = println("common function") 

// MODULE: JVM
fun whichFun(x: Int) = println("platform function")
```

If you call the `whichFun()` function in your common code, the function that has the most relevant argument type in the
library will be resolved:

```kotlin
// A project that uses the example library for the JVM target

// MODULE: common
fun main(){
    whichFun(2) 
    // platform function
}
```

In comparison, if you declare the overloads for `whichFun()` within the same source set, the function from the common
code will be resolved because your code doesn't have access to the platform-specific version:

```kotlin
// Example library isn't used

// MODULE: common
fun whichFun(x: Any) = println("common function") 

fun main(){
    whichFun(2) 
    // common function
}

// MODULE: JVM
fun whichFun(x: Int) = println("platform function")
```

Similar to multiplatform libraries, since the `commonTest` module is in a separate source set, it also still has access
to platform-specific code. Therefore, the resolution of calls to functions in the `commonTest` module exhibits the same
behavior as in the old compilation scheme.

In the future, these remaining cases will be more consistent with the new compilation scheme.

#### Different visibility levels of expected and actual declarations

Before Kotlin 2.0.0, if you used [expected and actual declarations](multiplatform-expect-actual.md) in your
Kotlin Multiplatform project, they had to have the same [visibility level](visibility-modifiers.md).
Kotlin 2.0.0 now also supports different visibility levels but **only** if the actual declaration is _more_ permissive than
the expected declaration. For example:

```kotlin
expect internal class Attribute // Visibility is internal
actual class Attribute          // Visibility is public by default,
                                // which is more permissive
```

Similarly, if you are using a [type alias](type-aliases.md) in your actual declaration, the visibility of the **underlying type**
should be the same or more permissive than the expected declaration. For example:

```kotlin
expect internal class Attribute                 // Visibility is internal
internal actual typealias Attribute = Expanded

class Expanded                                  // Visibility is public by default,
                                                // which is more permissive
```

## How to enable the Kotlin K2 compiler

Starting with Kotlin 2.0.0, the Kotlin K2 compiler is enabled by default.

To upgrade the Kotlin version, change it to 2.0.0 in your [Gradle](gradle-configure-project.md#apply-the-plugin) and
[Maven](maven.md#configure-and-enable-the-plugin) build scripts.

To have the best experience with IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, consider [enabling K2 Kotlin mode](#support-in-ides)
in your IDE.

### Use Kotlin build reports with Gradle

Kotlin [build reports](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#build-reports) provide information about the time spent in
different compilation phases for Kotlin compiler tasks, as well as which compiler and Kotlin version were used,
and whether the compilation was incremental. These build reports are useful for assessing your build performance. They
offer more insight into the Kotlin compilation pipeline than [Gradle build scans](https://scans.gradle.com/) do
because they give you an overview of the performance of all Gradle tasks.

#### How to enable build reports

To enable build reports, declare where you'd like to save the build report output in your `gradle.properties` file:

```none
kotlin.build.report.output=file
```

The following values and their combinations are available for the output:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `file` | Saves build reports in a human-readable format to a local file. By default, it's `${project_folder}/build/reports/kotlin-build/${project_name}-timestamp.txt` |
| `single_file` | Saves build reports in a format of an object to a specified local file. |
| `build_scan` | Saves build reports in the `custom values` section of the [build scan](https://scans.gradle.com/). Note that the Gradle Enterprise plugin limits the number of custom values and their length. In big projects, some values could be lost. |
| `http` | Posts build reports using HTTP(S). The POST method sends metrics in JSON format. You can see the current version of the sent data in the [Kotlin repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/libraries/tools/kotlin-gradle-plugin/src/common/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/gradle/report/data/GradleCompileStatisticsData.kt). You can find samples of HTTP endpoints in [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2022/06/introducing-kotlin-build-reports/?_gl=1*1a7pghy*_ga*MTcxMjc1NzE5Ny4xNjY1NDAzNjkz*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTcxNTA3NjA2NS4zNzcuMS4xNzE1MDc2MDc5LjQ2LjAuMA..&_ga=2.265800911.1124071296.1714976764-1712757197.1665403693#enable_build_reports) |
| `json` | Saves build reports in JSON format to a local file. Set the location for your build reports in `kotlin.build.report.json.directory`. By default, it's name is `${project_name}-build-<date-time>-<index>.json`. |

For more information on what is possible with build reports, see [Build reports](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#build-reports).

## Support in IDEs

{type="warning"}

By default, both IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio 2024.1 use the previous compiler for code analysis, code completion,
highlighting, and other IDE-related features. This is to ensure performance and stability while we work on integrating 
the new Kotlin K2 compiler.

If you'd like to try using the same features with the new Kotlin K2 compiler, support is available from IntelliJ IDEA and 
Android Studio 2024.1. To enable K2 Kotlin mode:

1. In your IDE, go to **Settings** | **Languages & Frameworks** | **Kotlin**.
2. Select the **Enable K2 Kotlin Mode** option.

Learn more about the K2 Kotlin mode in our [blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2024/05/intellij-idea-2024-2-eap-2/#improved-k2-mode).

> We plan to introduce [Stable](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained) language features after Kotlin 2.1.0.
> Until then, you can continue to use the previous compiler for code analysis, and you won't encounter any code highlighting
> issues due to unrecognized language features.
>
{type="note"}

It's important to note that regardless of which compiler you use for code analysis in your IDE, the compiler used
by your build system is **independent** and configured separately in your build script. If you [upgrade your Kotlin version
to Kotlin 2.0.0 in your build scripts](#how-to-enable-the-kotlin-k2-compiler), the new K2 compiler will be used by default
by your build system only.

## Try the Kotlin K2 compiler in the Kotlin Playground

The Kotlin Playground supports the 2.0.0 release. [Check it out!](https://pl.kotl.in/czuoQprce)

## How to roll back to the previous compiler

To use the previous compiler in Kotlin 2.0.0, either:

* In your `build.gradle.kts` file, [set your language version](gradle-compiler-options.md#example-of-setting-a-languageversion) to `1.9`.

  OR
* Use the following compiler option: `-language-version 1.9`.

## Changes

With the introduction of the new frontend, the Kotlin compiler has undergone several changes. Let's start by highlighting
the most significant modifications affecting your code, explaining what has changed and detailing best practices going
forward. If you'd like to learn more, we've organized these changes into [subject areas](#per-subject-area) to facilitate
your further reading.

This section highlights the following modifications:

* [Immediate initialization of open properties with backing fields](#immediate-initialization-of-open-properties-with-backing-fields)
* [Deprecated synthetic setters on a projected receiver](#deprecated-synthetics-setter-on-a-projected-receiver)
* [Forbidden use of inaccessible generic types](#forbidden-use-of-inaccessible-generic-types)
* [Consistent resolution order of Kotlin properties and Java fields with the same name](#consistent-resolution-order-of-kotlin-properties-and-java-fields-with-the-same-name)
* [Improved null safety for Java primitive arrays](#improved-null-safety-for-java-primitive-arrays)
* [Stricter rules for abstract members in expected classes](#stricter-rules-for-abstract-members-in-expected-classes)

### Immediate initialization of open properties with backing fields

**What's changed?**

In Kotlin 2.0, all `open` properties with backing fields must be immediately initialized; otherwise, you'll get a
compilation error. Previously, only `open var` properties needed to be initialized right away, but now this extends
to `open val` properties with backing fields too:

```kotlin
open class Base {
    open val a: Int
    open var b: Int
    
    init {
        // Error starting with Kotlin 2.0 that earlier compiled successfully 
        this.a = 1 //Error: open val must have initializer
        // Always an error
        this.b = 1 // Error: open var must have initializer
    }
}

class Derived : Base() {
    override val a: Int = 2
    override var b = 2
}
```

This change makes the compiler's behavior more predictable. Consider an example where an `open val` property is overridden
by a `var` property with a custom setter.

If a custom setter is used, deferred initialization can lead to confusion because it's unclear whether you want to
initialize the backing field or to invoke the setter. In the past, if you wanted to invoke the setter, the old compiler
couldn't guarantee that the setter would then initialize the backing field.

**What's the best practice now?**

We encourage you to always initialize open properties with backing fields, as we believe this practice is both more
efficient and less error-prone.

However, if you don't want to immediately initialize a property, you can:

* Make the property `final`.
* Use a private backing property that allows for deferred initialization.

### Deprecated synthetics setter on a projected receiver

**What's changed?**

If you use the synthetic setter of a Java class to assign a type that conflicts with the class's projected type,
an error is triggered.

Suppose you have a Java class named `Container` that contains the `getFoo()` and `setFoo()` methods:

```java
public class Container<E> {
    public E getFoo() {
        return null;
    }
    public void setFoo(E foo) {}
}
```

If you have the following Kotlin code, where instances of the `Container` class have projected types, using the `setFoo()`
method will always generate an error. However, only from Kotlin 2.0.0 will the synthetic `foo` property trigger an error:

```kotlin
fun exampleFunction(starProjected: Container<*>, inProjected: Container<in Number>, sampleString: String) {
    starProjected.setFoo(sampleString)
    // Error since Kotlin 1.0

    // Synthetic setter `foo` is resolved to the `setFoo()` method
    starProjected.foo = sampleString
    // Error since Kotlin 2.0.0

    inProjected.setFoo(sampleString)
    // Error since Kotlin 1.0

    // Synthetic setter `foo` is resolved to the `setFoo()` method
    inProjected.foo = sampleString
    // Error since Kotlin 2.0.0
}
```

**What's the best practice now?**

If you see that this change introduces errors in your code, you might wish to reconsider how you structure your type
declarations. It could be that you don't need to use type projections, or perhaps you need to remove any assignments
from your code.

For more information, see the [corresponding issue in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-54309).

### Forbidden use of inaccessible generic types

**What's changed?**

Due to the new architecture of our K2 compiler, we've changed how we handle inaccessible generic types. Generally, you 
should never rely on inaccessible generic types in your code because this indicates a misconfiguration in your project's 
build configuration, preventing the compiler from accessing the necessary information to compile. In Kotlin 2.0.0, you 
can't declare or call a function literal with an inaccessible generic type, nor use a generic type with inaccessible generic
type arguments. This restriction helps you avoid compiler errors later in your code.

For example, let's say that you declared a generic class in one module:


```kotlin
// Module one
class Node<V>(val value: V)
```

If you have another module (module two) with a dependency configured on module one, your code can access the `Node<V>` 
class and use it as a type in function types:

```kotlin
// Module two
fun execute(func: (Node<Int>) -> Unit) {}
// Function compiles successfully
```

However, if your project is misconfigured such that you have a third module (module three) that depends only on module 
two, the Kotlin compiler won't be able to access the `Node<V>` class in **module one** when compiling the third module. 
Now, any lambdas or anonymous functions in module three that use the `Node<V>` type trigger errors in Kotlin 2.0.0, thus
preventing avoidable compiler errors, crashes, and run-time exceptions later in your code:

```kotlin
// Module three
fun test() {
    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the implicit 
    // lambda parameter (it) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute {}

    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the unused 
    // lambda parameter (_) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute { _ -> }

    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the unused
    // anonymous function parameter (_) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute(fun (_) {})
}
```

In addition to function literals triggering errors when they contain value parameters of inaccessible generic types, 
errors also occur when a type has an inaccessible generic type argument.

For example, you have the same generic class declaration in module one. In module two, you declare another generic class:
`Container<C>`. In addition, you declare functions in module two that use `Container<C>` with generic class `Node<V>` as
a type argument:


<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Module one</td>
       <td>Module two</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
// Module one
class Node<V>(val value: V)
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
// Module two
class Container<C>(vararg val content: C)

// Functions with generic class type that
// also have a generic class type argument
fun produce(): Container<Node<Int>> = Container(Node(42))
fun consume(arg: Container<Node<Int>>) {}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


If you try to call these functions in module three, an error is triggered in Kotlin 2.0.0 because the generic class 
`Node<V>` is inaccessible from module three:

```kotlin
// Module three
fun test() {
    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as generic class Node<V> is 
    // inaccessible
    consume(produce())
}
```

In future releases we will continue to deprecate the use of inaccessible types in general. We have already started in 
Kotlin 2.0.0 by adding warnings for some scenarios with inaccessible types, including non-generic ones.

For example, let's use the same module setup as the previous examples, but turn the generic class `Node<V>` into a 
non-generic class `IntNode`, with all functions declared in module two:

<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Module one</td>
       <td>Module two</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
// Module one
class IntNode(val value: Int)
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
// Module two
// A function that contains a lambda 
// parameter with `IntNode` type
fun execute(func: (IntNode) -> Unit) {}

class Container<C>(vararg val content: C)

// Functions with generic class type
// that has `IntNode` as a type argument
fun produce(): Container<IntNode> = Container(IntNode(42))
fun consume(arg: Container<IntNode>) {}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

If you call these functions in module three, some warnings are triggered:

```kotlin
// Module three
fun test() {
    // Triggers warnings in Kotlin 2.0.0, as class IntNode is 
    // inaccessible.

    execute {}
    // Class 'IntNode' of the parameter 'it' is inaccessible.

    execute { _ -> }
    execute(fun (_) {})
    // Class 'IntNode' of the parameter '_' is inaccessible.

    // Will trigger a warning in future Kotlin releases, as IntNode is
    // inaccessible.
    consume(produce())
}
```

**What's the best practice now?**

If you encounter new warnings regarding inaccessible generic types, it's highly likely that there's an issue with your 
build system configuration. We recommend checking your build scripts and configuration. 

As a last resort, you can configure a direct dependency for module three on module one. Alternatively, you can modify 
your code to make the types accessible within the same module.

### Consistent resolution order of Kotlin properties and Java fields with the same name

**What's changed?**

Before Kotlin 2.0.0, if you worked with Java and Kotlin classes that inherited from each other and contained Kotlin
properties and Java fields with the same name, the resolution behavior of the duplicated name was inconsistent. There was
also conflicting behavior between IntelliJ IDEA and the compiler. When developing
the new resolution behavior for Kotlin 2.0.0, we aimed to cause the least impact to users.

For example, suppose there is a Java class `Base`:

```java
public class Base {
    public String a = "a";

    public String b = "b";
}
```

Let's say there is also a Kotlin class `Derived` that inherits from the aforementioned `Base` class:

```kotlin
class Derived : Base() {
    val a = "aa"

    // Declares custom get() function
    val b get() = "bb"
}

fun main() {
    // Resolves Derived.a
    println(a)
    // aa

    // Resolves Base.b
    println(b)
    // b
}
```

Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, `a` resolves to the Kotlin property within the `Derived` Kotlin class, whereas `b` resolves to
the Java field in the `Base` Java class.

In Kotlin 2.0.0, the resolution behavior in the example is consistent, ensuring that the Kotlin property supersedes the
Java field of the same name. Now, `b` resolves to: `Derived.b`.

> Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, if you used IntelliJ IDEA to go to the declaration or usage of `a`, it would incorrectly
> navigate to the Java field when it should have navigated to the Kotlin property.
> 
> From Kotlin 2.0.0, IntelliJ IDEA correctly navigates to the same location as the compiler.
>
{type ="note"}

The general rule is that the subclass takes precedence. The previous example demonstrates this, as the Kotlin property
`a` from the `Derived` class is resolved because `Derived` is a subclass of the `Base` Java class.

In the event that the inheritance is reversed and a Java class inherits from a Kotlin class, the Java field in the
subclass takes precedence over the Kotlin property with the same name.

Consider this example:

<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Kotlin</td>
       <td>Java</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
open class Base {
    val a = "aa"
}
```

</td>
<td>

```java
public class Derived extends Base {
    public String a = "a";
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Now in the following code:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Resolves Derived.a
    println(a)
    // a
}
```

**What's the best practice now?**

If this change affects your code, consider whether you really need to use duplicate names. If you want to have Java or
Kotlin classes that each contain a field or property with the same name and that each inherit from one another, keep in
mind that the field or property in the subclass will take precedence.

For more information, see the [corresponding issue in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-55017).

### Improved null safety for Java primitive arrays

**What's changed?**

Starting with Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler correctly infers the nullability of Java primitive arrays imported to Kotlin.
Now, it retains native nullability from the `TYPE_USE` annotations used with Java primitive arrays and emits errors when
their values are not used according to annotations.

Usually, when Java types with `@Nullable` and `@NotNull` annotations are called from Kotlin, they receive the appropriate
native nullability:

```java
interface DataService {
    @NotNull ResultContainer<@Nullable String> fetchData();
}
```
```kotlin
val dataService: DataService = ... 
dataService.fetchData() // -> ResultContainer<String?>
```

Previously, however, when Java primitive arrays were imported to Kotlin, all `TYPE_USE` annotations were lost, resulting
in platform nullability and possibly unsafe code:

```java
interface DataProvider {
    int @Nullable [] fetchData();
}
```

```kotlin
val dataService: DataProvider = ...
dataService.fetchData() // -> IntArray .. IntArray?
// No error, even though `dataService.fetchData()` might be `null` according to annotations
// This might result in a NullPointerException
dataService.fetchData()[0]
```
Note that this issue never affected nullability annotations on the declaration itself, only the `TYPE_USE` ones.

**What's the best practice now?**

In Kotlin 2.0.0, null safety for Java primitive arrays is now standard in Kotlin, so check your code for new warnings
and errors if you use them:

* Any code that uses a `@Nullable` Java primitive array without an explicit nullability check or attempts to pass `null`
  to a Java method expecting a non-nullable primitive array will now fail to compile.
* Using a `@NotNull` primitive array with a nullability check now emits "Unnecessary safe call" or "Comparison with null
  always false" warnings.

### Stricter rules for abstract members in expected classes

> Expected and actual classes are in [Beta](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> They are almost stable, but you may need to perform migration steps in the future.
> We'll do our best to minimize any further changes for you to make.
>
{type="warning"}

**What's changed?**

Due to the separation of common and platform sources during compilation with the K2 compiler, we've implemented stricter
rules for abstract members in expected classes.

With the previous compiler, it was possible for an expected non-abstract class to inherit an abstract function without 
[overriding the function](inheritance.md#overriding-rules). Since the compiler could access both common and platform code
at the same time, the compiler could see whether the abstract function had a corresponding override and definition in the
actual class.

Now that common and platform sources are compiled separately, the inherited function must be explicitly overridden in the
expected class so that the compiler knows the function is not abstract. Otherwise, the compiler reports an 
`ABSTRACT_MEMBER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` error.

For example, let's say you have a common source set where you declare an abstract class called `FileSystem` that has an 
abstract function `listFiles()`. You define the `listFiles()` function in the platform source set as part of an actual 
declaration.

In your common code, if you have an expected non-abstract class called `PlatformFileSystem` that inherits from the 
`FileSystem` class, the `PlatformFileSystem` class inherits the abstract function `listFiles()`. However, you can't have
an abstract function in a non-abstract class in Kotlin. To make the `listFiles()` function non-abstract, you must declare
it as an override without the `abstract` keyword:

<table header-style="top">
   <tr>
       <td>Common code</td>
       <td>Platform code</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
abstract class FileSystem {
    abstract fun listFiles()
}
expect open class PlatformFileSystem() : FileSystem {
    // In Kotlin 2.0.0, an explicit override is needed
    expect override fun listFiles()
    // Before Kotlin 2.0.0, an override wasn't needed
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
actual open class PlatformFileSystem : FileSystem {
    actual override fun listFiles() {}
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**What's the best practice now?**

If you inherit abstract functions in an expected non-abstract class, add a non-abstract override.

## Compatibility with Kotlin releases

The following Kotlin releases have support for the new K2 compiler:

| Kotlin release | Stability level |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 2.0.0          | Stable          |
| 1.9.20–1.9.25  | Beta            |
| 1.9.0–1.9.10   | JVM is Beta     |
| 1.7.0–1.8.22   | Alpha           |

## Compatibility with Kotlin libraries

If you're working with Kotlin/JVM, the K2 compiler works with libraries compiled with any version of Kotlin.

If you're working with Kotlin Multiplatform, the K2 compiler is guaranteed to work with libraries compiled with Kotlin 
version 1.9.20 and onwards.

## Compiler plugins support

Currently, the Kotlin K2 compiler supports the following Kotlin compiler plugins:

* [`all-open`](all-open-plugin.md)
* [AtomicFU](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-atomicfu)
* [`jvm-abi-gen`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/plugins/jvm-abi-gen)
* [`js-plain-objects`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/plugins/js-plain-objects)
* [kapt](whatsnew1920.md#preview-kapt-compiler-plugin-with-k2)
* [Lombok](lombok.md)
* [`no-arg`](no-arg-plugin.md)
* [Parcelize](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.parcelize)
* [SAM with receiver](sam-with-receiver-plugin.md)
* [Serialization](serialization.md)

In addition, the Kotlin K2 compiler supports:

* The [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) 1.5.0 compiler plugin and later versions.
* [Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)](ksp-overview.md) since [KSP2](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/ksp2-preview-kotlin-k2-standalone.html).

> If you use any additional compiler plugins, check their documentation to see if they are compatible with K2.

### Upgrade your custom compiler plugins

> Custom compiler plugins use the plugin API, which is [Experimental](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/components-stability.html#stability-levels-explained).
> As a result, the API may change at any time, so we can't guarantee backward compatibility.
>
{type="warning"}

The upgrade process has two paths depending on the type of custom plugin you have.

#### Backend-only compiler plugins

If your plugin implements only `IrGenerationExtension` extension points, the process is the same as for any other new 
compiler release. Check if there are any changes to the API that you use and make changes if necessary.

#### Backend and frontend compiler plugins

If your plugin uses frontend-related extension points, you need to rewrite the plugin using the new K2 compiler API. For
an introduction to the new API, see [FIR Plugin API](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/docs/fir/fir-plugins.md).
