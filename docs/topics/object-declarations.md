[//]: # (title: Object expressions and declarations)

Sometimes you need to create an object that is a slight modification of some class, without explicitly declaring a new
subclass for it. Kotlin can handle this with _object expressions_ and _object declarations_.

## Object expressions

_Object expressions_ create objects of anonymous classes, that is, classes that aren't explicitly declared with the `class`
declaration. Such classes are useful for one-time use. You can define them from scratch, inherit from existing classes,
or implement interfaces. Instances of anonymous classes are also called _anonymous objects_ because they are defined by
an expression, not a name.

### Creating anonymous objects from scratch

Object expressions start with the `object` keyword.

If you just need an object that doesn't have any nontrivial supertypes, write its members in curly braces after `object`:

```kotlin

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val helloWorld = object {
        val hello = "Hello"
        val world = "World"
        // object expressions extend Any, so `override` is required on `toString()`
        override fun toString() = "$hello $world"
    }

    print(helloWorld)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

### Inheriting anonymous objects from supertypes

To create an object of an anonymous class that inherits from some type (or types), specify this type after `object` and a
colon (`:`). Then implement or override the members of this class as if you were [inheriting](inheritance.md) from it:

```kotlin
window.addMouseListener(object : MouseAdapter() {
    override fun mouseClicked(e: MouseEvent) { /*...*/ }

    override fun mouseEntered(e: MouseEvent) { /*...*/ }
})
```

If a supertype has a constructor, pass appropriate constructor parameters to it.
Multiple supertypes can be specified as a comma-delimited list after the colon:

```kotlin
open class A(x: Int) {
    public open val y: Int = x
}

interface B { /*...*/ }

val ab: A = object : A(1), B {
    override val y = 15
}
```

### Using anonymous objects as return and value types

When an anonymous object is used as a type of a local or [private](visibility-modifiers.md#packages) but not [inline](inline-functions.md)
declaration (function or property), all its members are accessible via this function or property:

```kotlin
class C {
    private fun getObject() = object {
        val x: String = "x"
    }

    fun printX() {
        println(getObject().x)
    }
}
```

If this function or property is public or private inline, its actual type is:
* `Any` if the anonymous object doesn't have a declared supertype
* The declared supertype of the anonymous object, if there is exactly one such type
* The explicitly declared type if there is more than one declared supertype

In all these cases, members added in the anonymous object are not accessible. Overridden members are accessible if they
are declared in the actual type of the function or property:

```kotlin
interface A {
    fun funFromA() {}
}
interface B

class C {
    // The return type is Any; x is not accessible
    fun getObject() = object {
        val x: String = "x"
    }

    // The return type is A; x is not accessible
    fun getObjectA() = object: A {
        override fun funFromA() {}
        val x: String = "x"
    }

    // The return type is B; funFromA() and x are not accessible
    fun getObjectB(): B = object: A, B { // explicit return type is required
        override fun funFromA() {}
        val x: String = "x"
    }
}
```

### Accessing variables from anonymous objects

The code in object expressions can access variables from the enclosing scope:

```kotlin
fun countClicks(window: JComponent) {
    var clickCount = 0
    var enterCount = 0

    window.addMouseListener(object : MouseAdapter() {
        override fun mouseClicked(e: MouseEvent) {
            clickCount++
        }

        override fun mouseEntered(e: MouseEvent) {
            enterCount++
        }
    })
    // ...
}
```

## Object declarations
{id="object-declarations-overview"}

The [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) pattern can be useful in several cases,
and Kotlin makes it easy to declare singletons:

```kotlin
object DataProviderManager {
    fun registerDataProvider(provider: DataProvider) {
        // ...
    }

    val allDataProviders: Collection<DataProvider>
        get() = // ...
}
```

This is called an _object declaration_, and it always has a name following the `object` keyword.
Just like a variable declaration, an object declaration is not an expression, and it cannot be used on the right-hand side
of an assignment statement.

The initialization of an object declaration is thread-safe and done on first access.

To refer to the object, use its name directly:

```kotlin
DataProviderManager.registerDataProvider(...)
```

Such objects can have supertypes:

```kotlin
object DefaultListener : MouseAdapter() {
    override fun mouseClicked(e: MouseEvent) { ... }

    override fun mouseEntered(e: MouseEvent) { ... }
}
```

> Object declarations can't be local (that is, they can't be nested directly inside a function), but they can be nested
> into other object declarations or non-inner classes.

### Data objects

When printing a plain `object` declaration in Kotlin, the string representation contains both its name and the hash of the object:

```kotlin
object MyObject

fun main() {
    println(MyObject) // MyObject@1f32e575
}
```

Just like [data classes](data-classes.md), you can mark an `object` declaration with the `data` modifier. 
This instructs the compiler to generate a number of functions for your object:

* `toString()` returns the name of the data object
* `equals()`/`hashCode()` pair

  > You can't provide a custom `equals` or `hashCode` implementation for a `data object`.
  >
  {style="note"}

The `toString()` function of a data object returns the name of the object:
```kotlin
data object MyDataObject {
    val x: Int = 3
}

fun main() {
    println(MyDataObject) // MyDataObject
}
```

The `equals()` function for a `data object` ensures that all objects that have the type of your `data object` are considered equal.
In most cases, you will only have a single instance of your data object at runtime (after all, a `data object` declares a singleton).
However, in the edge case where another object of the same type is generated at runtime (for example, by using platform 
reflection with `java.lang.reflect` or a JVM serialization library that uses this API under the hood), this ensures that 
the objects are treated as being equal.

> Make sure that you only compare `data objects` structurally (using the `==` operator) and never by reference (using the `===` operator).
> This helps you to avoid pitfalls when more than one instance of a data object exists at runtime.
>
{style="warning"}

```kotlin
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor

data object MySingleton

fun main() {
    val evilTwin = createInstanceViaReflection()

    println(MySingleton) // MySingleton
    println(evilTwin) // MySingleton

    // Even when a library forcefully creates a second instance of MySingleton, its `equals` method returns true:
    println(MySingleton == evilTwin) // true

    // Do not compare data objects via ===.
    println(MySingleton === evilTwin) // false
}

fun createInstanceViaReflection(): MySingleton {
    // Kotlin reflection does not permit the instantiation of data objects.
    // This creates a new MySingleton instance "by force" (i.e. Java platform reflection)
    // Don't do this yourself!
    return (MySingleton.javaClass.declaredConstructors[0].apply { isAccessible = true } as Constructor<MySingleton>).newInstance()
}
```

The generated `hashCode()` function has behavior that is consistent with the `equals()` function, so that all runtime 
instances of a `data object` have the same hash code.

#### Differences between data objects and data classes

While `data object` and `data class` declarations are often used together and have some similarities, there are some 
functions that are not generated for a `data object`:

* No `copy()` function. Because a `data object` declaration is intended to be used as singleton objects, no `copy()` 
  function is generated. The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance, which would 
  be violated by allowing copies of the instance to be created.
* No `componentN()` function. Unlike a `data class`, a `data object` does not have any data properties. 
  Since attempting to destructure such an object without data properties would not make sense, no `componentN()` functions are generated.

#### Using data objects with sealed hierarchies

Data object declarations are particularly useful for sealed hierarchies like 
[sealed classes or sealed interfaces](sealed-classes.md), since they allow you to maintain symmetry with any data classes 
you may have defined alongside the object. In this example, declaring `EndOfFile` as a `data object` instead of a plain `object` 
means that it will get the `toString()` function without the need to override it manually:

```kotlin
sealed interface ReadResult
data class Number(val number: Int) : ReadResult
data class Text(val text: String) : ReadResult
data object EndOfFile : ReadResult

fun main() {
    println(Number(7)) // Number(number=7)
    println(EndOfFile) // EndOfFile
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" id="data-objects-sealed-hierarchies"}

### Companion objects

An object declaration inside a class can be marked with the `companion` keyword:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object Factory {
        fun create(): MyClass = MyClass()
    }
}
```

Members of the companion object can be called simply by using the class name as the qualifier:

```kotlin
val instance = MyClass.create()
```

The name of the companion object can be omitted, in which case the name `Companion` will be used:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object { }
}

val x = MyClass.Companion
```

Class members can access the private members of the corresponding companion object.

The name of a class used by itself (not as a qualifier to another name) acts as a reference to the companion
object of the class (whether named or not):

```kotlin
class MyClass1 {
    companion object Named { }
}

val x = MyClass1

class MyClass2 {
    companion object { }
}

val y = MyClass2
```

Note that even though the members of companion objects look like static members in other languages, at runtime those
are still instance members of real objects, and can, for example, implement interfaces:

```kotlin
interface Factory<T> {
    fun create(): T
}

class MyClass {
    companion object : Factory<MyClass> {
        override fun create(): MyClass = MyClass()
    }
}

val f: Factory<MyClass> = MyClass
```

However, on the JVM you can have members of companion objects generated as real static methods and fields if you use
the `@JvmStatic` annotation. See the [Java interoperability](java-to-kotlin-interop.md#static-fields) section
for more detail.

### Semantic difference between object expressions and declarations

There is one important semantic difference between object expressions and object declarations:

* Object expressions are executed (and initialized) _immediately_, where they are used.
* Object declarations are initialized _lazily_, when accessed for the first time.
* A companion object is initialized when the corresponding class is loaded (resolved) that matches the semantics of a Java
  static initializer.
