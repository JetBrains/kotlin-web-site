## Project ideas

### Build Server Protocol: add Kotlin support [Medium, 175 hrs]

The Kotlin team wants to expand official Kotlin support not only for Gradle and Maven build systems,
but any other build system as well and support them natively in JetBrains IDE with minimal effort.
On the other hand, we also want to provide basic Kotlin support in non-JetBrains IDE –
one part of such support is to be able to get Kotlin specific information from any build system supporting Kotlin.

The solution to these requirements could be a [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io) (BSP)
that provides an abstraction layer between build system and IDE.

The goal of this project would be implementing a prototype which uses the BSP protocol to get all required for 
IDEA information from a user project to be able to work with Kotlin code in the project. 
To limit the scope of this prototype – user project will be using Gradle to build itself.

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Understanding how to write Gradle plugins
* _Bonus_: understanding how to write IntelliJ IDEA plugins

**Possible mentor**

Yahor Berdnikau, and the JetBrains team

**Tasks for applicants**

* **Task #1**.
  Why are you interested in this project?

* **Task #2**.
  Practice assignment:
  create a Gradle plugin which exposes a specific task. This task should on the presence of 
  Kotlin Gradle Plugin get all the Kotlin sources structure and output to the file. Having tests is a bonus

### Support Android and iOS targets in Kotlin Multiplatform for an existing Google service [Medium, 175 hrs]

This project aims to create an open-source Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) library that supports an existing Google service 
on at least Android and iOS. This project will showcase best practices in creating KMP libraries for existing services,
with a focus on appropriate production implementation (for example, proper API key management, allowing user-managed API keys,
client throttling).

**Expected outcomes**

* A new Kotlin Multiplatform library with support for an existing Google service
* Sample code and documentation

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Kotlin Multiplatform
* Mobile development (Android and iOS)

**Possible mentor**

### Add Kotlin Multiplatform support in Bazel [Hard, 350 hrs]

Bazel's support for Kotlin is evolving, but proper Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) integration remains a challenge.
This project aims to improve [Bazel's KMP support](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin/issues/567)
by addressing dependency resolution issues, enhancing `rules_kotlin` and `rules_jvm_external` compatibility,
and enabling cross-platform builds.

Key improvements will focus on handling platform-specific dependencies (expect/actual mechanisms), 
improving Gradle metadata support, and ensuring a smoother developer experience for KMP in Bazel.

**Expected outcomes**

* Enhanced dependency resolution for Kotlin Multiplatform in Bazel
* Improved integration with `rules_kotlin` and `rules_jvm_external`
* A working KMP build setup in Bazel for seamless multiplatform development

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin Multiplatform and Gradle
* Bazel build system
* Dependency resolution strategies

### Kotlin Language Server (LSP) [Hard, 350 hrs]

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a widely adopted standard that enables code intelligence features such as autocompletion,
go-to definition, and refactoring across different editors and IDEs. There is currently no official Kotlin LSP server.
Uber has developed an internal Kotlin LSP, but a publicly maintained, community-driven implementation 
can support broader use cases, including code migration, AI-powered code assistance, 
and seamless integration into various development environments.

This project aims to develop a Kotlin LSP implementation, ensuring compatibility with key LSP features
and broadening Kotlin's accessibility across development environments.

**Expected outcomes**

Develop a Kotlin LSP implementation

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Language Server Protocol (LSP)
* Plugin or extension development for IDEs

**Possible mentor**

### Maven Central publishing plugin for Gradle with new APIs [Medium, 175 hrs]

[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/) is one of the most popular Maven repositories for publishing 
JVM-focused libraries and projects. It is actively used by Apache Maven or Gradle-based open-source projects, 
and based on Sonatype Nexus v2, pending migration to a newer version. There is ongoing migration of open source projects
to a new Maven Central Instance, which has a very different API implementation and needs special support in the build tool plugins.
Developing a Gradle plugin that is compatible with the new Maven Central publication APIs would help
the library authors building with Gradle to have a smooth experience with the new process.

Currently, there are multiple implementations of Maven Central publishing plugins in Gradle,
for example, the [Maven Publish Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html)
or the [New Maven Central Publishing](https://github.com/GradleUp/nmcp), which already tries to adopt the new APIs.
A potential contributor, during the application or the community bonding phase, would need to review the implementations
and suggest a plugin to be updated, or decide to build a new plugin or fork.
The deliverables would include either a new version of an existing plugin for Maven Central publishing or a new plugin for Gradle.
We anticipate the implementation to be in Kotlin or Java and to have proper test coverage and documentation.
Additional deliverables may include Kotlin DSL extensions to simplify the use of the plugins and
[Declarative Gradle](https://declarative.gradle.org/) extensions.

**Expected outcomes**

* Updated Maven Central publishing plugin or a new plugin

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* Maven Repositories

### Improving Configuration Cache and lock contention in key Gradle plugins [Easy to Hard, 90 hrs to 350 hrs]

Gradle is working on [Isolated Projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/isolated_projects.html) – a new feature
that greatly extends the configuration cache to further improve performance, particularly the performance of
Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA sync. From the developer experience standpoint, it is one of the most expected features in Gradle.

One of the problems for Isolated projects is the lock contention in the Gradle core and plugins sometimes getting in the way of parallel execution.
We would like to reduce the lock contention, especially in the key Gradle Build Tool plugins for Java, Kotlin, Android,
and Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystems. Contributors are welcome to choose the deliverables, based on their interest and the desired project size.

Potential deliverables include but not limited to:
* Embed the [Configuration Cache Report](https://github.com/gradle/configuration-cache-report) tool into the Gradle Profiler (or implement a GitHub Action for it)
* Profile Gradle and a few popular Gradle plugins in various projects, with automation of the test suite on GHA
* Determine potential areas and plugins where lock contention can be reduced, with or without Configuration Cache
* While around, contribute to other areas of [Configuration Cache compatibility](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13490) in the target plugins
* Implement some of the discovered improvements

**Expected outcomes**

Implementing extensibility features in the Kotlin DSL for Gradle and improving support for common project integrations

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Gradle 
* Java
* Performance analysis
* Profiling

### Gradle convention plugin for developing Jenkins plugins [Easy to Hard, 90 hrs to 350 hrs]

There are more than 50 Jenkins plugins that are implemented with Gradle. 
There is a [Gradle JPI plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin),
but it is not fully compliant with Jenkins hosting requirements, and needs an update.
In this project idea, the aim would be to recover the Gradle developer flow for Jenkins, reach feature parity with the
Apache Maven flow ([Parent POM](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom),
[Plugin Compatibility Tester](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-compat-tester),
[Jenkins Bill of Materials](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom), and others),
and to improve the developer experience for those who develop Jenkins plugins with Gradle.

Contributors are welcome to choose the deliverables, based on their interest and the desired project size.

Potential deliverables include but not limited to:
* Refreshing the Gradle JPI plugin and making it compliant with hosting best practices
* Migrating the Gradle JPI plugin codebase from Groovy to Kotlin
* Implementing a new convention plugin for Jenkins Plugins that would cover the main features of Jenkins plugin Parent POM, with Kotlin and Kotlin DSL.
  This would include not just building the plugin, but also testing and static analysis according to Jenkins' best practices
* Adopting the refreshed plugin and/or the convention plugin in the most popular Gradle plugin, including the Gradle Plugin itself
* Integrating Gradle Plugins into Plugin Compatibility Tester and Bill of Materials
* Documenting the updated Gradle development flow for Jenkins plugins

**Expected outcomes**

Updated Gradle JPI Plugin AND/OR new convention plugin for Jenkins, published on Jenkins Update Center and Gradle Plugin Portal

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin DSL
* Kotlin
* Gradle
* Jenkins
* Java

**Possible mentor**

### Kotlin DSL and Declarative Gradle documentation samples test framework [Easy to Medium, 90 hrs to 175 hrs]

Many projects, including Gradle, have a lot of Kotlin DSL samples and code snippets (see the Gradle Docs for examples). 
Testing them against multiple versions poses certain challenges because the snippets often represent incomplete code 
for the sake of brevity. We would like to build a test framework that simplifies the verification of those samples 
within a unit test framework (Kotest or JUnit 5) on GitHub Actions or Teamcity. Later we would be interested in
doing the same for [Declarative Gradle](https://declarative.gradle.org/) samples.

**Expected outcomes**

Implementing extensibility features in the Kotlin DSL for Gradle and improving support for common project integrations

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* Java
* Static analysis

**Possible mentor**

### IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin – Gradle Reporting and Parallel Verifications [Medium, 175 hrs]

The [IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin),
a plugin for the Gradle build system, simplifies configuring your environment for building, testing, verifying,
and publishing plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs. The plugin manages the build, test, 
and verification steps while keeping up with the constant changes introduced in the IntelliJ Platform.
The IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is used by JetBrains, third-party developers,
and external companies to integrate their workflows with JetBrains tools.

**Expected outcomes**

* Introduce Gradle Reporting to provide detailed, configurable verification task reports.
* Utilize Gradle Worker API to enable parallel execution of the verifyPlugin task against multiple IntelliJ Platform versions, reducing the task execution time.
* Explore additional Gradle enhancements to further improve plugin development workflows.

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* IntelliJ Platform
