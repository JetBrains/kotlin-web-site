[//]: # (title: Basic types)

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that you can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some types can have a special internal representation – for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime – but to the user they look like ordinary classes. 

This section describes the basic types used in Kotlin:
* [Numbers](numbers.md) and their [unsigned counterparts](unsigned-integer-types.md)
* [Booleans](booleans.md)
* [Characters](characters.md)
* [Strings](strings.md)
* [Arrays](arrays.md)
