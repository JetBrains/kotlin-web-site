## Kotlin logo

Our logo consists of a mark and a typeface. The full color version is the main one and should be used in the vast majority of cases.

**Full color version**: (png) (svg) (ai)  
**Monochrome version**: (png) (svg) (ai)  
**Single color version**: (png) (svg) (ai)  

Our logo and mark have a protective field. Please position the logo so that other design elements do not come into the box. The minimum size of the protective field is half the height of the mark.

Pay special attention to the following restrictions concerning the use of the logo:

* Do not separate the mark from the text. Do not swap elements.
* Do not change the transparency of the logo.
* Do not outline the logo.
* Do not repaint the logo in third-party colors.
* Do not change the text.
* Do not set the logo against a complex background. Do not place the logo in front of a bright background.

## Font

We use JetBrains Sans in size 400 as our main corporate font.
The font was developed specifically for JetBrains by the designer Philipp Nurullin.
It is the property of the company and requires a license to use.
When we cannot use our font, for example in Google slide presentations, we use Inter Regular.

## Colors

Our style has three main colors:

* Blue as a display color. We apply this color to important buttons on websites or to our logo in cases where the full color version cannot be used.
* Black for the dark theme, which is the priority theme. We apply this color to backgrounds and text.
* White for the light theme, which is a secondary theme. We apply this color to backgrounds and text.

Our style uses two types of gradients:
* A linear gradient for the logo and other style constants. It consists of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the gradient scale. Please do not change the sequence of colors on the scale.
* A gradient mesh for banner backgrounds. It consists of four colors equidistant from each other. Please do not make abrupt transitions between colors.
