## Kotlin Logo

Our logo consists of a mark and a typeface. 
The full-color version is the main one and should be used in the vast majority of cases.

[Download all versions](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/kotlin/docs/kotlin_logos.zip){:.typo-float-right.kto-button.kto-button_size_m.kto-button_mode_outline}

![Kotlin logo](kotlin-logo.png){width=700}

Our logo and mark have a protective field. Please position the logo so that other design elements do not come into the box.
The minimum size of the protective field is half the height of the mark.

Pay special attention to the following restrictions concerning the use of the logo:

* Do not separate the mark from the text. Do not swap elements.
* Do not change the transparency of the logo.
* Do not outline the logo.
* Do not repaint the logo in third-party colors.
* Do not change the text.
* Do not set the logo against a complex background. Do not place the logo in front of a bright background.

## Kotlin mascot

Kodee is Kotlin's reimagined mascot. More than just a symbol, Kodee is your friendly companion who’s there to encourage 
and inspire you to express your creativity.
When using it, we ask you to follow these [simple guidelines](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/kotlin/docs/Kotlin_Mascot_Guidelines.pdf).

![Kotlin mascot Kodee proportions](mascot-body-proportions.png){width=700}

You can use Kodee in your digital and print materials. For this purpose, we have prepared a variety of 
Kotlin mascot assets for you to download and explore.

## Kotlin User Group brand assets

We provide Kotlin user groups with a logo that is specifically designed to be recognizable and convey a reference to Kotlin.

* The official Kotlin logo is associated with the language itself. It should not be used otherwise in different scopes, 
   as this could cause confusion. The same applies to its close derivatives.
* User groups logo also means that the opinions and actions of the community are independent of the Kotlin team.
* Your opinions don't have to agree with ours, and we think this is the most beneficial model for a creative and strong community.

### Style for user groups

Since the launch of the Kotlin community support program at the beginning of 2017, the number of user groups has multiplied,
with around 2–4 new user groups joining us every month. Please check out the complete list of groups in 
the **Kotlin User Groups** section to find one in your area.

We provide new Kotlin user groups with a user group logo and a profile picture.

![Branding image](kotlin-user-group-logo.png){width=700}

There are two main reasons why we are doing it:

* Firstly, we received many requests from the community asking for special Kotlin style branded materials 
   to help them be recognized as officially dedicated user groups.
* Secondly, we wanted to provide a distinct style for the user group and community content to make it clear 
   which Kotlin-related materials are from the official team and which are created by the community.

### Create the logo of your user group

To create a logo of your users group:
1. Copy the Kotlin user group [logo file](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IcJp8Z2jAwEliXrHB-l9RNK_2LrqGTkNuPPtjrW1iIU/edit) to your Google drive (you have to be signed in to your Google account).
2. Replace the **Your City** text with the name of your user group.
