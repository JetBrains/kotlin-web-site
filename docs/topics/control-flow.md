[//]: # (title: Conditions and loops)

## If expression

In Kotlin, `if` is an expression: it returns a value.
Therefore, there is no ternary operator (`condition ? then : else`) because ordinary `if` works fine in this role.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val a = 2
    val b = 3

    //sampleStart
    var max = a
    if (a < b) max = b

    // With else
    if (a > b) {
      max = a
    } else {
      max = b
    }

    // As expression
    max = if (a > b) a else b

    // You can also use `else if` in expressions:
    val maxLimit = 1
    val maxOrLimit = if (maxLimit > a) maxLimit else if (a > b) a else b

    //sampleEnd
    println("max is $max")
    println("maxOrLimit is $maxOrLimit")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3" id="if-else-if-kotlin"}

Branches of an `if` expression can be blocks. In this case, the last expression is the value of a block:

```kotlin
val max = if (a > b) {
    print("Choose a")
    a
} else {
    print("Choose b")
    b
}
```

If you're using `if` as an expression, for example, for returning its value or
assigning it to a variable, the `else` branch is mandatory.

## When expression

`when` defines a conditional expression with multiple branches. It is similar to the `switch` statement in C-like languages.
Its simple form looks like this.

```kotlin
when (x) {
    1 -> print("x == 1")
    2 -> print("x == 2")
    else -> {
        print("x is neither 1 nor 2")
    }
}
```

`when` matches its argument against all branches sequentially until some branch condition is satisfied.

`when` can be used either as an expression or as a statement. If it is used as an expression, the value
of the first matching branch becomes the value of the overall expression. If it is used as a statement, the values of
individual branches are ignored. Just like with `if`, each branch can be a block, and its value
is the value of the last expression in the block.

The `else` branch is evaluated if none of the other branch conditions are satisfied.

If `when` is used as an _expression_, the `else` branch is mandatory,
unless the compiler can prove that all possible cases are covered with branch conditions,
for example, with [`enum` class](enum-classes.md) entries and [`sealed` class](sealed-classes.md) subtypes).

```kotlin
enum class Bit {
    ZERO, ONE
}

val numericValue = when (getRandomBit()) {
    Bit.ZERO -> 0
    Bit.ONE -> 1
    // 'else' is not required because all cases are covered
}
```

In `when` _statements_, the `else` branch is mandatory in the following conditions:
* `when` has a subject of a `Boolean`, [`enum`](enum-classes.md),
or [`sealed`](sealed-classes.md) type, or their nullable counterparts.
* branches of `when` don't cover all possible cases for this subject.

```kotlin
enum class Color {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE
}

when (getColor()) {  
    Color.RED -> println("red")
    Color.GREEN -> println("green")   
    Color.BLUE -> println("blue")
    // 'else' is not required because all cases are covered
}

when (getColor()) {
    Color.RED -> println("red") // no branches for GREEN and BLUE
    else -> println("not red") // 'else' is required
}
```


To define a common behavior for multiple cases, combine their conditions in a single line with a comma: 

```kotlin
when (x) {
    0, 1 -> print("x == 0 or x == 1")
    else -> print("otherwise")
}
```

You can use arbitrary expressions (not only constants) as branch conditions

```kotlin
when (x) {
    s.toInt() -> print("s encodes x")
    else -> print("s does not encode x")
}
```

You can also check a value for being `in` or `!in` a [range](ranges.md) or a collection:

```kotlin
when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> print("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> print("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> print("x is outside the range")
    else -> print("none of the above")
}
```

Another option is checking that a value `is` or `!is` of a particular type. Note that,
due to [smart casts](typecasts.md#smart-casts), you can access the methods and properties of the type without
any extra checks.

```kotlin
fun hasPrefix(x: Any) = when(x) {
    is String -> x.startsWith("prefix")
    else -> false
}
```

`when` can also be used as a replacement for an `if`-`else` `if` chain.
If no argument is supplied, the branch conditions are simply boolean expressions, and a branch is executed when its condition is true:

```kotlin
when {
    x.isOdd() -> print("x is odd")
    y.isEven() -> print("y is even")
    else -> print("x+y is odd")
}
```

You can capture *when* subject in a variable using following syntax:

```kotlin
fun Request.getBody() =
    when (val response = executeRequest()) {
        is Success -> response.body
        is HttpError -> throw HttpException(response.status)
    }
```

The scope of variable introduced in *when* subject is restricted to the body of this *when*.

### Guard conditions in when expressions

> Guard conditions are an [experimental feature](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained) that may be changed at any time.
> We would appreciate your feedback in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71140/Guard-conditions-in-when-expressions-feedback).
>
{style="warning"}

Guard conditions allow you to include 
more than one condition to the branches of a `when` expression, making complex control flow more explicit and concise.
You can use guard conditions in `when` expressions or statements with a subject.

To include a guard condition in a branch, place it after the primary condition, separated by `if`:

```kotlin
sealed interface Animal {
    data class Cat(val mouseHunter: Boolean) : Animal
    data class Dog(val breed: String) : Animal
}

fun feedAnimal(animal: Animal) {
    when (animal) {
        // Branch with only primary condition. Returns `feedDog()` when `Animal` is `Dog`
        is Animal.Dog -> feedDog()
        // Branch with both primary and guard conditions. Returns `feedCat()` when `Animal` is `Cat` and is not `mouseHunter`
        is Animal.Cat if !animal.mouseHunter -> feedCat()
        // Returns "Unknown animal" if none of the above conditions match
        else -> println("Unknown animal")
    }
}
```

In a single `when` expression, you can combine branches with and without guard conditions. 
The code in a branch with a guard condition runs only if both the primary condition and the guard condition evaluate to true.
If the primary condition does not match, the guard condition is not evaluated. 

If you use guard conditions in `when` statements without an `else` branch, and none of the conditions matches, none of the branches is executed. 

Otherwise, if you use guard conditions in `when` expressions without an `else` branch, the compiler requires you to declare all the possible cases to avoid runtime errors.

Additionally, guard conditions support `else if`:

```kotlin
when (animal) {
    // Checks if `animal` is `Dog`
    is Animal.Dog -> feedDog()
    // Guard condition that checks if `animal` is `Cat` and not `mouseHunter`
    is Animal.Cat if !animal.mouseHunter -> feedCat()
    // Returns giveLettuce() if none of the above conditions match and animal.eatsPlants is true
    else if animal.eatsPlants -> giveLettuce()
    // Returns "Unknown animal" if none of the above conditions match
    else -> println("Unknown animal")
}
```

Combine multiple guard conditions within a single branch using the boolean operators `&&` (AND) or `||` (OR).
Use parentheses around the boolean expressions to [avoid confusion](coding-conventions.md#guard-conditions-in-when-expression):

```kotlin
when (animal) {
    is Animal.Cat if (!animal.mouseHunter && animal.hungry) -> feedCat()
}
```

You can use guard conditions in any `when` expression or statement with a subject, except the case when you have multiple conditions separated by a comma.
For example, `0, 1 -> print("x == 0 or x == 1")`.

> To enable guard conditions in CLI, run the following command:
>
> `kotlinc -Xwhen-guards main.kt`
>
> To enable guard conditions in Gradle, add the following line to the `build.gradle.kts` file:
>
> `kotlin.compilerOptions.freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwhen-guards")t`

## For loops

The `for` loop iterates through anything that provides an iterator. This is equivalent to the `foreach` loop in languages like C#.
The syntax of `for` is the following:

```kotlin
for (item in collection) print(item)
```

The body of `for` can be a block.

```kotlin
for (item: Int in ints) {
    // ...
}
```

As mentioned before, `for` iterates through anything that provides an iterator. This means that it:

* has a member or an extension function `iterator()` that returns `Iterator<>`, which:
  * has a member or an extension function `next()`
  * has a member or an extension function `hasNext()` that returns `Boolean`.

All of these three functions need to be marked as `operator`.

To iterate over a range of numbers, use a [range expression](ranges.md):

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1..3) {
        println(i)
    }
    for (i in 6 downTo 0 step 2) {
        println(i)
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

A `for` loop over a range or an array is compiled to an index-based loop that does not create an iterator object.

If you want to iterate through an array or a list with an index, you can do it this way:

```kotlin
fun main() {
val array = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
//sampleStart
    for (i in array.indices) {
        println(array[i])
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Alternatively, you can use the `withIndex` library function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val array = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
//sampleStart
    for ((index, value) in array.withIndex()) {
        println("the element at $index is $value")
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

## While loops

`while` and `do-while` loops execute their body continuously while their condition is satisfied.
The difference between them is the condition checking time:
* `while` checks the condition and, if it's satisfied, executes the body and then returns to the condition check.
* `do-while` executes the body and then checks the condition. If it's satisfied, the loop repeats. So, the body of `do-while`
executes at least once regardless of the condition. 

```kotlin
while (x > 0) {
    x--
}

do {
    val y = retrieveData()
} while (y != null) // y is visible here!
```

## Break and continue in loops

Kotlin supports traditional `break` and `continue` operators in loops. See [Returns and jumps](returns.md).
