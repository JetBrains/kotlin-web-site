[//]: # (title: Reflection)

_Reflection_ is a set of language and library features that allows for introspecting the structure of your own program at runtime.
Kotlin makes functions and properties first-class citizens in the language, and introspecting them (for example, learning a name or 
a type of a property or function at runtime) is closely intertwined with simply using a functional or reactive style.

## JVM dependency

On the JVM platform, the runtime component required for using the reflection features is distributed as a separate
artifact `kotlin-reflect.jar` in the Kotlin compiler distribution. This is done to reduce the required size of the runtime
library for applications that do not use reflection features.

To use reflection in a Gradle or Maven project, add the dependency on `kotlin-reflect`:
* In Gradle:

    <tabs>
    
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:%kotlinVersion%"
    }
    ```
    
    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
        implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:%kotlinVersion%")
    }
    ```
    
    </tabs>

* In Maven:
    
    ```xml
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
          <artifactId>kotlin-reflect</artifactId>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

If you don't use Gradle or Maven, make sure you have `kotlin-reflect.jar` in the classpath of your project.
In other supported cases (IntelliJ IDEA projects, using command-line compiler or Ant),
it is added by default. In command-line compiler and Ant, you can use `-no-reflect` compiler option to exclude
`kotlin-reflect.jar` from the classpath. 

## Class references

The most basic reflection feature is getting the runtime reference to a Kotlin class. To obtain the reference to a
statically known Kotlin class, you can use the _class literal_ syntax:

```kotlin
val c = MyClass::class
```

The reference is a value of type [KClass](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-class/index.html).

>On JVM: a Kotlin class reference is not the same as a Java class reference. To obtain a Java class reference,
>use the `.java` property on a `KClass` instance.

### Bound class references

You can get the reference to a class of a specific object with the same `::class` syntax by using the object as a receiver:

```kotlin
val widget: Widget = ...
assert(widget is GoodWidget) { "Bad widget: ${widget::class.qualifiedName}" }
```

You obtain the reference to an exact class of an object, for instance `GoodWidget` or `BadWidget`,
despite the type of the receiver expression (`Widget`).

## Callable references

References to functions, properties, and constructors, apart from introspecting the program structure, can 
also be called or used as instances of [function types](lambdas.md#function-types).

The common supertype for all callable references is [`KCallable<out R>`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-callable/index.html), 
where `R` is the return value type, which is the property type for properties, and the constructed type for constructors. 

### Function references

When you have a named function declared like this:

```kotlin
fun isOdd(x: Int) = x % 2 != 0
```

You can call it directly (`isOdd(5)`). Alternatively, you can use it as a function type value: pass it 
to another function. To do this, use the `::` operator:

```kotlin
fun isOdd(x: Int) = x % 2 != 0

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3)
    println(numbers.filter(::isOdd))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Here `::isOdd` is a value of function type `(Int) -> Boolean`.

Function references belong to one of the [`KFunction<out R>`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-function/index.html)
subtypes, depending on the parameter count, for example, `KFunction3<T1, T2, T3, R>`.

`::` can be used with overloaded functions when the expected type is known from the context.
For example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun isOdd(x: Int) = x % 2 != 0
    fun isOdd(s: String) = s == "brillig" || s == "slithy" || s == "tove"
    
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3)
    println(numbers.filter(::isOdd)) // refers to isOdd(x: Int)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Alternatively, you can provide the necessary context by storing the method reference in a variable with an explicitly specified type:

```kotlin
val predicate: (String) -> Boolean = ::isOdd   // refers to isOdd(x: String)
```

If you need to use a member of a class, or an extension function, it needs to be qualified: `String::toCharArray`.

Note that even if you initialize a variable with a reference to an extension function, the inferred function type will
have no receiver (it will have an additional parameter accepting a receiver object). To have a function type 
with receiver instead, specify the type explicitly:

```kotlin
val isEmptyStringList: List<String>.() -> Boolean = List<String>::isEmpty 
```

#### Example: function composition

Consider the following function:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> compose(f: (B) -> C, g: (A) -> B): (A) -> C {
    return { x -> f(g(x)) }
}
```

It returns a composition of two functions passed to it: `compose(f, g) = f(g(*))`.
Now, you can apply it to callable references:

```kotlin
fun <A, B, C> compose(f: (B) -> C, g: (A) -> B): (A) -> C {
    return { x -> f(g(x)) }
}

fun isOdd(x: Int) = x % 2 != 0

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun length(s: String) = s.length
    
    val oddLength = compose(::isOdd, ::length)
    val strings = listOf("a", "ab", "abc")
    
    println(strings.filter(oddLength))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Property references

To access properties as first-class objects in Kotlin, use the `::` operator:

```kotlin
val x = 1

fun main() {
    println(::x.get())
    println(::x.name) 
}
```

The expression `::x` evaluates to a property object of type `KProperty<Int>`. You can read its
value using `get()` or retrieve the property name using the `name` property. For more information, see 
the [docs on the `KProperty` class](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-property/index.html).

For a mutable property such as `var y = 1`, `::y` returns a value of type [`KMutableProperty<Int>`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-mutable-property/index.html),
which has a `set()` method:

```kotlin
var y = 1

fun main() {
    ::y.set(2)
    println(y)
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

A property reference can be used where a function with a single generic parameter is expected:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val strs = listOf("a", "bc", "def")
    println(strs.map(String::length))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

To access a property that is a member of a class, qualify it:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    class A(val p: Int)
    val prop = A::p
    println(prop.get(A(1)))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

For an extension property:

```kotlin
val String.lastChar: Char
    get() = this[length - 1]

fun main() {
    println(String::lastChar.get("abc"))
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Interoperability with Java reflection

On the JVM platform, standard library contains extensions for reflection classes that provide a mapping to and from Java
reflection objects (see package `kotlin.reflect.jvm`).
For example, to find a backing field or a Java method that serves as a getter for a Kotlin property, you can write something like this:

```kotlin
import kotlin.reflect.jvm.*
 
class A(val p: Int)
 
fun main() {
    println(A::p.javaGetter) // prints "public final int A.getP()"
    println(A::p.javaField)  // prints "private final int A.p"
}
```

To get the Kotlin class corresponding to a Java class, use the `.kotlin` extension property:

```kotlin
fun getKClass(o: Any): KClass<Any> = o.javaClass.kotlin
```

### Constructor references

Constructors can be referenced just like methods and properties. You can use them wherever an object of function type 
is expected that takes the same parameters as the constructor and returns an object of the appropriate type. 
Constructors are referenced by using the `::` operator and adding the class name. Consider the following function 
that expects a function parameter with no parameters and return type `Foo`:

```kotlin
class Foo

fun function(factory: () -> Foo) {
    val x: Foo = factory()
}
```

Using `::Foo`, the zero-argument constructor of the class `Foo`, you can call it like this:

```kotlin
function(::Foo)
```

Callable references to constructors are typed as one of the 
[`KFunction<out R>`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect/-k-function/index.html) subtypes
depending on the parameter count.

### Bound function and property references

You can refer to an instance method of a particular object:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numberRegex = "\\d+".toRegex()
    println(numberRegex.matches("29"))
     
    val isNumber = numberRegex::matches
    println(isNumber("29"))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Instead of calling the method `matches` directly, the example uses a reference to it.
Such reference is bound to its receiver.
It can be called directly (like in the example above) or used whenever an expression of function type is expected:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numberRegex = "\\d+".toRegex()
    val strings = listOf("abc", "124", "a70")
    println(strings.filter(numberRegex::matches))
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Compare the types of bound and the corresponding unbound references.
Bound callable reference has its receiver "attached" to it, so the type of the receiver is no longer a parameter:

```kotlin
val isNumber: (CharSequence) -> Boolean = numberRegex::matches

val matches: (Regex, CharSequence) -> Boolean = Regex::matches
```

Property reference can be bound as well:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val prop = "abc"::length
    println(prop.get())
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

You don't need to specify `this` as the receiver: `this::foo` and `::foo` are equivalent.

### Bound constructor references

A bound callable reference to a constructor of an [inner class](nested-classes.md#inner-classes) can 
be obtained by providing an instance of the outer class:

```kotlin
class Outer {
    inner class Inner
}

val o = Outer()
val boundInnerCtor = o::Inner
```
