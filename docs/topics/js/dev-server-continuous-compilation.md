[//]: # (title: Development server and continuous compilation)

Instead of manually compiling and running your Kotlin/JS project each time you want to see the changes you made,
you can use the _continuous compilation_ mode. Rather than using the regular `jsBrowserDevelopmentRun` (for `browser`) and `jsNodeDevelopmentRun` (for `nodejs`) command, invoke the Gradle wrapper
in continuous mode:

```bash
 # For `browser` project
./gradlew jsBrowserDevelopmentRun --continuous

 # For `nodejs` project
./gradlew jsNodeDevelopmentRun --continuous
```

If you are working in IntelliJ IDEA, you can pass the same flag via the list of run configurations. After running the 
`jsBrowserDevelopmentRun` Gradle task for the first time from the IDE, IntelliJ IDEA automatically generates a run configuration for it,
which you can edit at the top toolbar:

Enable continuous mode via the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog by adding the `--continuous` flag to the
arguments for the run configuration:

When executing this run configuration, you can note that the Gradle process continues watching for changes to the program:

![Gradle waiting for changes](waiting-for-changes.png){width=700}

Once a change has been detected, the program is recompiled automatically. If you still have the web page open in the browser,
the development server triggers an automatic reload of the page, and the changes become visible.
This is thanks to the integrated [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) that is managed by the [Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-dsl-reference.html).
