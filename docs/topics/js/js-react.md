[//]: # (title: Build a web application with React and Kotlin/JS â€” tutorial)

This tutorial will teach you how to build a browser application with Kotlin/JS and the [React](https://reactjs.org/)
framework. You will:

* Complete common tasks associated with building a typical React application.
* Explore how [Kotlin's DSLs](type-safe-builders.md) can be used to help express concepts concisely and uniformly without
  sacrificing readability, allowing you to write a full-fledged application completely in Kotlin.
* Learn how to use ready-made npm components, use external libraries, and publish the final application.

The output will be a _KotlinConf Explorer_ web app dedicated to the [KotlinConf](https://kotlinconf.com/) event,
with links to conference talks. Users will be able to watch all the talks on one page and mark them as seen or unseen.

The tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of Kotlin and basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Understanding the basic
concepts behind React may help you understand some sample code, but it is not strictly required.

## Before you start

1. Download and install the latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).
2. Clone the [project template](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle) and open it in IntelliJ
   IDEA. The template includes a basic Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle project with all required configurations and dependencies

   * Dependencies and tasks in the `build.gradle.kts` file:
   
   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       // React, React DOM + Wrappers
       implementation(enforcedPlatform("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-wrappers-bom:1.0.0-pre.430"))
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react")
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-dom")
   
       // Kotlin React Emotion (CSS)
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-emotion")
   
       // Video Player
       implementation(npm("react-player", "2.12.0"))
   
       // Share Buttons
       implementation(npm("react-share", "4.4.1"))
   
       // Coroutines & serialization
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.5.0")
   }
   ```

   * An HTML template page in `src/jsMain/resources/index.html` for inserting JavaScript code that you'll be using in
   this tutorial:

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>Hello, Kotlin/JS!</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script src="confexplorer.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   {validate="false"}

   Kotlin/JS projects are automatically bundled with all of your code and its dependencies into a single JavaScript file
   with the same name as the project, `confexplorer.js`, when you build them. As a typical [JavaScript convention](https://faqs.skillcrush.com/article/176-where-should-js-script-tags-be-linked-in-html-documents),
   the content of the body (including the `root` div) is loaded first to ensure that the browser loads all page elements
   before the scripts.

* A code snippet in `src/jsMain/kotlin/Main.kt`:

   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.browser.document
   
   fun main() {
       document.bgColor = "red"
   }
   ```

### Run the development server

By default, the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin comes with support for an embedded `webpack-dev-server`, allowing you to run
the application from the IDE without manually setting up any servers.

To test that the program successfully runs in the browser, start the development server by invoking the `run` or
`browserDevelopmentRun` task (available in the `other` or `kotlin browser` directory) from the Gradle tool window inside
IntelliJ IDEA:

![Gradle tasks list](browser-development-run.png){width=700}

To run the program from the Terminal, use `./gradlew run` instead.

When the project is compiled and bundled, a blank red page will appear in a browser window:

![Blank red page](red-page.png){width=700}

### Enable hot reload / continuous mode

Configure _[continuous compilation](dev-server-continuous-compilation.md)_ mode so you don't have to manually compile and
execute your project every time you make changes. Make sure to stop all running development server instances before
proceeding.

1. Edit the run configuration that IntelliJ IDEA automatically generates after running the Gradle `run` task for the first time:

   ![Edit a run configuration](edit-configurations-continuous.png){width=700}

2. In the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog, add the `--continuous` option to the arguments for the run configuration:

   ![Enable continuous mode](continuous-mode.png){width=700}

   After applying the changes, you can use the **Run** button inside IntelliJ IDEA to start the development server back up.
   To run the continuous Gradle builds from the Terminal, use `./gradlew run --continuous` instead.

3. To test this feature, change the color of the page to blue in the `Main.kt` file while the Gradle task is running:

   ```kotlin
   document.bgColor = "blue"
   ```

   The project then recompiles, and after a reload the browser page will be the new color.

You can keep the development server running in continuous mode during the development process. It will automatically
rebuild and reload the page when you make changes.

> You can find this state of the project on the `master` branch [here](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle/tree/master).

## Create a web app draft

### Add the first static page with React

To make your app display a simple message, replace the code in the `Main.kt` file with the following:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.browser.document
import react.*
import emotion.react.css
import csstype.Position
import csstype.px
import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.h1
import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.h3
import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.div
import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.p
import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.img
import react.dom.client.createRoot
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable

fun main() {
    val container = document.getElementById("root") ?: error("Couldn't find root container!")
    createRoot(container).render(Fragment.create {
        h1 {
            +"Hello, React+Kotlin/JS!"
        }
    })
}
```
{validate="false"}

* The `render()` function instructs [kotlin-react-dom](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react-dom)
  to render the first HTML element inside a [fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) to the `root` element.
  This element is a container defined in `src/jsMain/resources/index.html`, which was included in the template.
* The content is an `<h1>` header and uses a typesafe DSL to render HTML.
* `h1` is a function that takes a lambda parameter. When you add the `+` sign in front of a string literal,
  the `unaryPlus()` function is actually invoked using [operator overloading](operator-overloading.md).
  It appends the string to the enclosed HTML element.

When the project recompiles, the browser displays this HTML page:

![An HTML page example](hello-react-js.png){width=700}

### Convert HTML to Kotlin's typesafe HTML DSL

The Kotlin [wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/blob/master/kotlin-react/README.md) for React come
with a [domain-specific language (DSL)](type-safe-builders.md) that makes it possible to write HTML in
pure Kotlin code. In this way, it's similar to [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) from JavaScript.
However, with this markup being Kotlin, you get all the benefits of a statically typed language, such as autocomplete or
type checking.

Compare the classic HTML code for your future web app and its typesafe variant in Kotlin:

<tabs>
<tab title="HTML">

```html
<h1>KotlinConf Explorer</h1>
<div>
    <h3>Videos to watch</h3>
    <p>John Doe: Building and breaking things</p>
    <p>Jane Smith: The development process</p>
    <p>Matt Miller: The Web 7.0</p>
    <h3>Videos watched</h3>
    <p>Tom Jerry: Mouseless development</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>John Doe: Building and breaking things</h3>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/640x360.png?text=Video+Player+Placeholder">
</div>
```

</tab>
<tab title="Kotlin">

```kotlin
h1 {
    +"KotlinConf Explorer"
}
div {
    h3 {
        +"Videos to watch"
    }
    p {
        + "John Doe: Building and breaking things"
    }
    p {
        +"Jane Smith: The development process"
    }
    p {
        +"Matt Miller: The Web 7.0"
    }
    h3 {
        +"Videos watched"
    }
    p {
        +"Tom Jerry: Mouseless development"
    }
}
div {
    h3 {
        +"John Doe: Building and breaking things"
    }
    img {
       src = "https://via.placeholder.com/640x360.png?text=Video+Player+Placeholder"
    }
}
```

</tab>
</tabs>

Copy the Kotlin code and update the `Fragment.create()` function call inside the `main()` function, replacing the previous `h1` tag.

Wait for the browser to reload. The page should now look like this:

![The web app draft](website-draft.png){width=700}

### Add videos using Kotlin constructs in markup

There are some advantages to writing HTML in Kotlin using this DSL. You can manipulate your app using regular Kotlin
constructs, like loops, conditions, collections, and string interpolation.

You can now replace the hardcoded list of videos with a list of Kotlin objects:

1. In `Main.kt`, create a `Video` [data class](data-classes.md) to keep all video attributes in one place:

   ```kotlin
   data class Video(
       val id: Int,
       val title: String,
       val speaker: String,
       val videoUrl: String
   )
   ```

2. Fill up the two lists, for unwatched videos and watched videos, respectively. Add these declarations at
   file-level in `Main.kt`:

   ```kotlin
   val unwatchedVideos = listOf(
       Video(1, "Opening Keynote", "Andrey Breslav", "https://youtu.be/PsaFVLr8t4E"),
       Video(2, "Dissecting the stdlib", "Huyen Tue Dao", "https://youtu.be/Fzt_9I733Yg"),
       Video(3, "Kotlin and Spring Boot", "Nicolas Frankel", "https://youtu.be/pSiZVAeReeg")
   )
   
   val watchedVideos = listOf(
       Video(4, "Creating Internal DSLs in Kotlin", "Venkat Subramaniam", "https://youtu.be/JzTeAM8N1-o")
   )
   ```

3. To use these videos on the page, write a Kotlin `for` loop to iterate over the collection of unwatched `Video` objects.
   Replace the three `p` tags under "Videos to watch" with the following snippet:

   ```kotlin
   for (video in unwatchedVideos) {
       p {
           +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
       }
   }
   ```
   
4. Apply the same process to modify the code for the single tag following "Videos watched" as well:

   ```kotlin
   for (video in watchedVideos) {
       p {
           +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
       }
   }
   ```

Wait for the browser to reload. The layout should stay the same as before. You can add some more videos to the list to make
sure that the loop is working.

### Add styles with typesafe CSS

The [kotlin-emotion](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/blob/master/kotlin-emotion/) wrapper for the [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
library makes it possible to specify CSS attributes â€“ even dynamic ones â€“ right alongside HTML with JavaScript. Conceptually, that
makes it similar to [CSS-in-JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#what-is-css-in-js) â€“ but for Kotlin.
The benefit of using a DSL is that you can use Kotlin code constructs to express formatting rules.

The template project for this tutorial already includes the dependency needed to use `kotlin-emotion`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    // Kotlin React Emotion (CSS) (chapter 3)
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-emotion")
    // ...
}
```

With `kotlin-emotion`, you can specify a `css` block inside HTML elements `div` and `h3`, where you can define the styles.

To move the video player to the top right-hand corner of the page, use CSS and adjust the code for the video player
(the last `div` in the snippet):

```kotlin
div {
    css {
        position = Position.absolute
        top = 10.px
        right = 10.px
    }
    h3 {
        +"John Doe: Building and breaking things"
    }
    img {
        src = "https://via.placeholder.com/640x360.png?text=Video+Player+Placeholder"
    }
}
```

Feel free to experiment with some other styles. For example, you could change the `fontFamily` or add some `color` to your UI.

## Design app components

The basic building blocks in React are called _[components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)_.
Components themselves can also be composed of other, smaller components. By combining components, you build your application.
If you structure components to be generic and reusable, you'll be able to use them in multiple parts of the app without
duplicating code or logic.

The content of the `render()` function generally describes a basic component. The current layout of your application looks
like this:

![Current layout](current-layout.png){width=700}

If you decompose your application into individual components, you'll end up with a more structured layout in which
each component handles its responsibilities:

![Structured layout with components](structured-layout.png){width=700}

Components encapsulate a particular functionality. Using components shortens source code and makes it easier to read and
understand.

### Add the main component

To start creating the application's structure, first explicitly specify `App`, the main component for rendering to the
`root`element:

1. Create a new `App.kt` file in the `src/jsMain/kotlin` folder.
2. Inside this file, add the following snippet and move the typesafe HTML from `Main.kt` into it:

   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.coroutines.async
   import react.*
   import react.dom.*
   import kotlinx.browser.window
   import kotlinx.coroutines.*
   import kotlinx.serialization.decodeFromString
   import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json
   import emotion.react.css
   import csstype.Position
   import csstype.px
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.h1
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.h3
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.div
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.p
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.img
   
   val App = FC<Props> {
       // typesafe HTML goes here, starting with the first h1 tag!
   }
   ```
   
   The `FC` function creates a [function component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components).

3. In the `Main.kt` file, update the `main()` function as follows:

   ```kotlin
   fun main() {
       val container = document.getElementById("root") ?: error("Couldn't find root container!")
       createRoot(container).render(App.create())
   }
   ```

   Now the program creates an instance of the `App` component and renders it to the specified container.

For more information about React concepts, see the [documentation and guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html#how-to-read-this-guide).

### Extract a list component

Since the `watchedVideos` and `unwatchedVideos` lists each contain a list of videos, it makes sense to create a single
reusable component, and only adjust the content displayed in the lists.

The `VideoList` component follows the same pattern as the `App` component. It uses the `FC` builder function,
and contains the code from the `unwatchedVideos` list.

1. Create a new `VideoList.kt` file in the `src/jsMain/kotlin` folder and add the following code:

   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.browser.window
   import react.*
   import react.dom.*
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.p
   
   val VideoList = FC<Props> {
       for (video in unwatchedVideos) {
           p {
               +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. In `App.kt`, use the `VideoList` component by invoking it without parameters:

   ```kotlin
   // . . .

   div {
       h3 {
           +"Videos to watch"
       }
       VideoList()
   
       h3 {
           +"Videos watched"
       }
       VideoList()
   }

   // . . .
   ```

   For now, the `App` component has no control over the content that is shown by the `VideoList` component. It's hard-coded,
   so you see the same list twice.

### Add props to pass data between components

Since you're going to reuse the `VideoList` component, you'll need to be able to fill it with different content. You can add
the ability to pass the list of items as an attribute to the component. In React, these attributes are called _props_.
When the props of a component are changed in React, the framework automatically re-renders the component.

For `VideoList`, you'll need a prop containing the list of videos to be shown. Define an interface
that holds all the props which can be passed to a `VideoList` component:

1. Add the following definition to the `VideoList.kt` file:

   ```kotlin
   external interface VideoListProps : Props {
       var videos: List<Video>
   }
   ```
   The [external](js-interop.md#external-modifier) modifier tells the compiler that the interface's implementation is provided
   externally, so it doesn't try to generate JavaScript code from the declaration.

2. Adjust the class definition of `VideoList` to make use of the props that are passed into the `FC` block as a parameter:

   ```kotlin
   val VideoList = FC<VideoListProps> { props ->
       for (video in props.videos) {
           p {
               key = video.id.toString()
               +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   The `key` attribute helps the React renderer figure out what to do when the value of `props.videos` changes. It uses
   the key to determine which parts of a list need to be refreshed and which ones stay the same. You can find more information
   about lists and keys in the [React guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html).

3. In the `App` component, make sure that the child components are instantiated with the proper attributes. In `App.kt`,
   replace the two loops underneath the `h3` elements with an invocation of `VideoList` together with the attributes for
   `unwatchedVideos` and `watchedVideos`.
   In the Kotlin DSL, you assign them inside a block belonging to the `VideoList` component:

   ```kotlin
   h3 {
       +"Videos to watch"
   }
   VideoList {
       videos = unwatchedVideos
   }
   h3 {
       +"Videos watched"
   }
   VideoList {
       videos = watchedVideos
   }
   ```

After a reload, the browser will show that the lists now render correctly.

### Make the list interactive

First, add an alert message that pops up when users click on a list entry. In `VideoList.kt`, add an
`onClick` handler function that triggers an alert with the current video:

```kotlin
// . . .

p {
    key = video.id.toString()
    onClick = {
        window.alert("Clicked $video!")
    }
    +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
}

// . . .
```

If you click on one of the list items in the browser window, you'll get information about the video in an alert
window like this:

![Browser alert window](alert-window.png){width=700}

> Defining an `onClick` function directly as lambda is concise and very useful for prototyping. However, due to the way equality
> [currently works](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-15101) in Kotlin/JS, performance-wise it's not the most optimized way
> to pass click handlers. If you want to optimize rendering performance, consider storing your functions in a variable
> and passing them.
>
{style="tip"}

### Add state to keep values

Instead of just alerting the user, you can add some functionality for highlighting the selected video with a â–¶ triangle.
To do that, introduce some _state_ specific to this component.

State is one of the core concepts in React. In modern React (which uses the so-called _Hooks API_),
state is expressed using the [`useState` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

1. Add the following code to the top of the `VideoList` declaration:

   ```kotlin
   val VideoList = FC<VideoListProps> { props ->
       var selectedVideo: Video? by useState(null)

   // . . .
   ```
   {validate="false"}

   * The `VideoList` functional component keeps state (a value that is independent of the current function invocation). State is nullable, and has the `Video?` type. Its default value is `null`.
   * The `useState()` function from React instructs the framework to keep track of state across multiple invocations
     of the function. For example, even though you specify a default value, React makes sure that the default value is only
     assigned in the beginning. When state changes, the component will re-render based on the new state.
   * The `by` keyword indicates that `useState()` acts as a [delegated property](delegated-properties.md).
     Like with any other variable, you read and write values. The implementation behind `useState()` takes care of the machinery
     required to make state work.

   To learn more about the State Hook, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

2. Change the `onClick` handler and the text in the `VideoList` component to look as follows:

   ```kotlin
   val VideoList = FC<VideoListProps> { props ->
       var selectedVideo: Video? by useState(null)
       for (video in props.videos) {
           p {
               key = video.id.toString()
               onClick = {
                   selectedVideo = video
               }
               if (video == selectedVideo) {
                   +"â–¶ "
               }
               +"${video.speaker}: ${video.title}"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   * When the user clicks a video, its value is assigned to the `selectedVideo` variable.
   * When the selected list entry is rendered, the triangle is prepended.

You can find more details about state management in the [React FAQ](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html).

Check the browser and click an item in the list to make sure that everything is working correctly.

## Compose components

Currently, the two video lists work on their own, meaning that each list keeps track of a selected video.
Users can select two videos, one in the unwatched list and one in watched, even though there's only one player:

![Two videos are selected in both lists simultaneously](two-videos-select.png){width=700}

A list can't keep track of which video is selected both inside itself, and inside a sibling list. The reason is that the
selected video is part not of the _list_ state, but of the _application_ state. This means you need to _lift_ state
out of the individual components.

### Lift state

React makes sure that props can only be passed from a parent component to its children. This prevents components from
being hard-wired together.

If a component wants to change state of a sibling component, it needs to do so via its parent.
At that point, state also no longer belongs to any of the child components but to the overarching parent component.

The process of migrating state from components to their parents is called _lifting state_. For your app, add `currentVideo`
as state to the `App` component:

1. In `App.kt`, add the following to the top of the definition of the `App` component:

   ```kotlin
   val App = FC<Props> {
       var currentVideo: Video? by useState(null)
   
       // . . .
   }
   ```

   The `VideoList` component no longer needs to keep track of state. It will receive the current video as a prop instead.

2. Remove the `useState()` call in `VideoList.kt`.
3. Prepare the `VideoList` component to receive the selected video as a prop. To do so, expand the `VideoListProps`
   interface to contain the `selectedVideo`:

   ```kotlin
   external interface VideoListProps : Props {
       var videos: List<Video>
       var selectedVideo: Video?
   }
   ```

4. Change the condition of the triangle so that it uses `props` instead of `state`:

   ```kotlin
   if (video == props.selectedVideo) {
       +"â–¶ "
   }
   ```

### Pass handlers

At the moment, there's no way to assign a value to a prop, so the `onClick` function won't work the way it is currently
set up. To change state of a parent component, you need to lift state again.

In React, state always flows from parent to child. So, to change the _application_ state from one of the child components,
you need to move the logic for handling user interaction to the parent component and then pass the logic in as a prop.
Remember that in Kotlin, variables can have the [type of a function](lambdas.md#function-types).

1. Expand the `VideoListProps` interface again so that it contains a variable `onSelectVideo`, which is a function that takes a
   `Video` and returns `Unit`:

   ```kotlin
   external interface VideoListProps : Props {
       // ...
       var onSelectVideo: (Video) -> Unit
   }
   ```

2. In the `VideoList` component, use the new prop in the `onClick` handler:

   ```kotlin
   onClick = {
       props.onSelectVideo(video)
   }
   ```
   
   You can now delete the `selectedVideo` variable from the `VideoList` component.

3. Go back to the `App` component and pass `selectedVideo` and a handler for `onSelectVideo`
   for each of the two video lists:

   ```kotlin
   VideoList {
       videos = unwatchedVideos // and watchedVideos respectively
       selectedVideo = currentVideo
       onSelectVideo = { video ->
           currentVideo = video
       }
   }
   ```

4. Repeat the previous step for the watched videos list.

Switch back to your browser and make sure that when selecting a video the selection jumps between the two lists without duplication.

## Add more components

### Extract the video player component

You can now create another self-contained component, a video player, which is currently a placeholder image. Your video player
needs to know the talk title, the author of the talk, and the link to the video. This information is already contained
in each `Video` object, so you can pass it as a prop and access its attributes.

1. Create a new `VideoPlayer.kt` file and add the following implementation for the `VideoPlayer` component:

   ```kotlin
   import csstype.*
   import react.*
   import emotion.react.css
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.button
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.div
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.h3
   import react.dom.html.ReactHTML.img
   
   external interface VideoPlayerProps : Props {
       var video: Video
   }
   
   val VideoPlayer = FC<VideoPlayerProps> { props ->
       div {
           css {
               position = Position.absolute
               top = 10.px
               right = 10.px
           }
           h3 {
               +"${props.video.speaker}: ${props.video.title}"
           }
           img {
               src = "https://via.placeholder.com/640x360.png?text=Video+Player+Placeholder"              
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Because the `VideoPlayerProps` interface specifies that the `VideoPlayer` component takes a non-nullable `Video`, make
   sure to handle this in the `App` component accordingly.

   In `App.kt`, replace the previous `div` snippet for the video player with the following:

   ```kotlin
   currentVideo?.let { curr ->
       VideoPlayer {
           video = curr
       }
   }
   ```

   The [`let` scope function](scope-functions.md#let) ensures that the `VideoPlayer` component is only added
   when `state.currentVideo` is not null.

Now clicking an entry in the list will bring up the video player and populate it with the information from the clicked entry.

### Add a button and wire it

To make it possible for users to mark a video as watched or unwatched and to move it between the two lists,
add a button to the `VideoPlayer` component.

Since this button will move videos between two different lists, the logic handling state change needs to be _lifted_
out of the `VideoPlayer` and passed in from the parent as a prop. The button should look different based on whether the
video has been watched or not. This is also information you need to pass as a prop.

1. Expand the `VideoPlayerProps` interface in `VideoPlayer.kt` to include properties for those two cases:

   ```kotlin
   external interface VideoPlayerProps : Props {
       var video: Video
       var onWatchedButtonPressed: (Video) -> Unit
       var unwatchedVideo: Boolean
   }
   ```

2. You can now add the button to the actual component. Copy the following snippet into the body of the `VideoPlayer`
   component, between the `h3` and `img` tags:

   ```kotlin
   button {
       css {
           display = Display.block
           backgroundColor = if (props.unwatchedVideo) NamedColor.lightgreen else NamedColor.red
       }
       onClick = {
           props.onWatchedButtonPressed(props.video)
       }
       if (props.unwatchedVideo) {
           +"Mark as watched"
       } else {
           +"Mark as unwatched"
       }
   }
   ```

   With the help of Kotlin CSS DSL that make it possible to change styles dynamically, you can change the color of the button using
   a basic Kotlin `if` expression.

### Move video lists to the application state

Now it's time to adjust the `VideoPlayer` usage site in the `App` component. When the button is clicked, a video
should be moved from the unwatched list to the watched list or vice versa. Since these lists can now actually
change, move them into the application state:

1. In `App.kt`, add the following properties with `useState()` calls to the top of the `App` component:

   ```kotlin
   val App = FC<Props> {
       var currentVideo: Video? by useState(null)
       var unwatchedVideos: List<Video> by useState(listOf(
           Video(1, "Opening Keynote", "Andrey Breslav", "https://youtu.be/PsaFVLr8t4E"),
           Video(2, "Dissecting the stdlib", "Huyen Tue Dao", "https://youtu.be/Fzt_9I733Yg"),
           Video(3, "Kotlin and Spring Boot", "Nicolas Frankel", "https://youtu.be/pSiZVAeReeg")
       ))
       var watchedVideos: List<Video> by useState(listOf(
           Video(4, "Creating Internal DSLs in Kotlin", "Venkat Subramaniam", "https://youtu.be/JzTeAM8N1-o")
       ))

       // . . .
   }
   ```

2. Since all the demo data is included in the default values for `watchedVideos` and `unwatchedVideos` directly,
   you no longer need the file-level declarations. In `Main.kt`, delete the declarations for `watchedVideos` and `unwatchedVideos`.
3. Change the call-site for `VideoPlayer` in the `App` component that belongs to the video player to look like this:

   ```kotlin
   VideoPlayer {
       video = curr
       unwatchedVideo = curr in unwatchedVideos
       onWatchedButtonPressed = {
           if (video in unwatchedVideos) {
               unwatchedVideos = unwatchedVideos - video
               watchedVideos = watchedVideos + video
           } else {
               watchedVideos = watchedVideos - video
               unwatchedVideos = unwatchedVideos + video
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Go back to the browser, select a video, and press the button a few times. The video will jump between the two lists.

## Use packages from npm

To make the app usable, you still need a video player that actually plays videos and some buttons to help people
share the content.

React has a rich ecosystem with a lot of pre-made components you can use instead of building this functionality yourself.

### Add the video player component

To replace the placeholder video component with an actual YouTube player, use the `react-player` package from npm.
It can play videos and allows you to control the appearance of the player.

For the component documentation and the API description, see its [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player)
in GitHub.

1. Check the `build.gradle.kts` file. The `react-player` package should be already included:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       // ...
       // Video Player
       implementation(npm("react-player", "2.12.0"))
       // ...
   }
   ```

   As you can see, npm dependencies can be added to a Kotlin/JS project by using the `npm()` function in the `dependencies`
   block of the build file. The Gradle plugin then takes care of downloading and installing these dependencies for you.
   To do so, it uses its own bundled installation of the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.

2. To use the JavaScript package from inside the React application, it's necessary to tell the Kotlin compiler what to
   expect by providing it with [external declarations](js-interop.md).

   Create a new `ReactYouTube.kt` file and add the following content:

   ```kotlin
   @file:JsModule("react-player")
   @file:JsNonModule
   
   import react.*
   
   @JsName("default")
   external val ReactPlayer: ComponentClass<dynamic>
   ```

   When the compiler sees an external declaration like `ReactPlayer`, it assumes that the implementation for the
   corresponding class is provided by the dependency and doesn't generate code for it.

   The last two lines are equivalent to a JavaScript import like `require("react-player").default;`. They tell
   the compiler that it's certain that a component will conform to `ComponentClass<dynamic>` at runtime.

However, in this configuration, the generic type for the props accepted by `ReactPlayer` is set to `dynamic`. That means
the compiler will accept any code, at the risk of breaking things at runtime.

A better alternative is to create an `external interface` that specifies what kind of properties belong to the
props for this external component. You can learn about the props' interface in the [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player)
for the component. In this case, use the `url` and `controls` props:

1. Adjust the content of `ReactYouTube.kt` by replacing `dynamic` with an external interface:

   ```kotlin
   @file:JsModule("react-player")
   @file:JsNonModule
   
   import react.*
   
   @JsName("default")
   external val ReactPlayer: ComponentClass<ReactPlayerProps>
   
   external interface ReactPlayerProps : Props {
       var url: String
       var controls: Boolean
   }
   ```

2. You can now use the new `ReactPlayer` to replace the gray placeholder rectangle in the `VideoPlayer` component. In
   `VideoPlayer.kt`, replace the `img` tag with the following snippet:

   ```kotlin
   ReactPlayer {
       url = props.video.videoUrl
       controls = true
   }
   ```

### Add social share buttons

An easy way to share the application's content is to have social share buttons for messengers and email. You can use
an off-the-shelf React component for this as well, for example, [react-share](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share/blob/master/README.md):

1. Check the `build.gradle.kts` file. This npm library should already be included:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       // ...
       // Share Buttons
       implementation(npm("react-share", "4.4.1"))
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. To use `react-share` from Kotlin, you'll need to write more basic external declarations. The [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share/blob/master/demo/Demo.tsx#L61)
   show that a share button consists of two React components: `EmailShareButton` and `EmailIcon`, for example. Different types
   of share buttons and icons all have the same kind of interface.
   You'll create the external declarations for each component the same way you already did for the video player.

   Add the following code to a new `ReactShare.kt` file:

   ```kotlin
   @file:JsModule("react-share")
   @file:JsNonModule
   
   import react.ComponentClass
   import react.Props
   
   @JsName("EmailIcon")
   external val EmailIcon: ComponentClass<IconProps>
   
   @JsName("EmailShareButton")
   external val EmailShareButton: ComponentClass<ShareButtonProps>
   
   @JsName("TelegramIcon")
   external val TelegramIcon: ComponentClass<IconProps>
   
   @JsName("TelegramShareButton")
   external val TelegramShareButton: ComponentClass<ShareButtonProps>
   
   external interface ShareButtonProps : Props {
       var url: String
   }
   
   external interface IconProps : Props {
       var size: Int
       var round: Boolean
   }
   ```

3. Add new components into the user interface of the application. In `VideoPlayer.kt`, add two share buttons in a `div`
   right above the usage of `ReactPlayer`:

   ```kotlin
   // . . .

   div {
       css {
            position = Position.absolute
            top = 10.px
            right = 10.px
        }
       EmailShareButton {
           url = props.video.videoUrl
           EmailIcon {
               size = 32
               round = true
           }
       }
       TelegramShareButton {
           url = props.video.videoUrl
           TelegramIcon {
               size = 32
               round = true
           }
       }
   }

   // . . .
   ```

You can now check your browser and see whether the buttons actually work. When clicking on the button, a _share window_ should
appear with the URL of the video. If the buttons don't show up or work, you may need to disable your ad and social media blocker.

![Share window](social-buttons.png){width=700}

Feel free to repeat this step with share buttons for other social networks available in [react-share](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share/blob/master/README.md#features).

## Use an external REST API

You can now replace the hard-coded demo data with some real data from a REST API in the app.

For this tutorial, there's a [small API](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/kotlin-hands-on/kotlinconf-json/videos/1).
It offers only a single endpoint, `videos`, and takes a numeric parameter to access an element from the list. If you visit
the API with your browser, you will see that the objects returned from the API have the same structure as `Video` objects.

### Use JS functionality from Kotlin

Browsers already come with a large variety of [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). You can also use
them from Kotlin/JS, since it includes wrappers for these APIs out of the box. One example is the
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which is used for making HTTP requests.

The first potential issue is that browser APIs like `fetch()` use [callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)
to perform non-blocking operations. When multiple callbacks are supposed to run one after the other, they need to be nested.
Naturally, the code gets heavily indented, with more and more pieces of functionality stacked inside each other, which makes it harder to read.

To overcome this, you can use Kotlin's coroutines, a better approach for such functionality.

The second issue arises from the dynamically typed nature of JavaScript. There are no guarantees about the type
of data returned from the external API. To solve this, you can use the `kotlinx.serialization` library.

Check the `build.gradle.kts` file. The relevant snippet should already exist:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // . . .

    // Coroutines & serialization
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")
}
```

### Add serialization

When you call an external API, you get back JSON-formatted text that still needs to be turned into a Kotlin object that
can be worked with.

[`kotlinx.serialization`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) is a library that makes it possible to write
these types of conversions from JSON strings to Kotlin objects.

1. Check the `build.gradle.kts` file. The corresponding snippet should already exist:

   ```kotlin
   plugins {
       // . . .
       kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "%kotlinVersion%"
   }
   
   dependencies {
       // . . .

       // Serialization
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.5.0")
   }
   ```

2. As preparation for fetching the first video, it's necessary to tell the serialization library about the `Video` class.
   In `Main.kt`, add the `@Serializable` annotation to its definition:

   ```kotlin
   @Serializable
   data class Video(
       val id: Int,
       val title: String,
       val speaker: String,
       val videoUrl: String
   )
   ```

### Fetch videos

To fetch a video from the API, add the following function in `App.kt` (or a new file):

```kotlin
suspend fun fetchVideo(id: Int): Video {
    val response = window
        .fetch("https://my-json-server.typicode.com/kotlin-hands-on/kotlinconf-json/videos/$id")
        .await()
        .text()
        .await()
    return Json.decodeFromString(response)
}
```

* _Suspending function_ `fetch()` fetches a video with a given `id` from the API. This response may take a while, so you `await()`
  the result. Next, `text()`, which uses a callback, reads the body from the response. Then you `await()` its completion.
* Before returning the value of the function, you pass it to `Json.decodeFromString`, a function from `kotlinx.coroutines`.
  It converts the JSON text you received from the request into a Kotlin object with the appropriate fields.
* The `window.fetch` function call returns a `Promise` object. You normally would have to define a callback handler that gets
  invoked once the `Promise` is resolved and a result is available. However, with coroutines, you can `await()` those promises.
  Whenever a function like `await()` is called, the method stops (suspends) its execution. Its execution continues once
  the `Promise` can be resolved.

To give users a selection of videos, define the `fetchVideos()` function, which will fetch 25 videos from the same API
as above. To run all the requests concurrently, use the [`async`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/async.html)
functionality provided by Kotlin's coroutines:

1. Add the following implementation to your `App.kt`:

   ```kotlin
   suspend fun fetchVideos(): List<Video> = coroutineScope {
       (1..25).map { id ->
           async {
               fetchVideo(id)
           }
       }.awaitAll()
   }
   ```

   Following the principle of [structured concurrency](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html#structured-concurrency),
   the implementation is wrapped in a `coroutineScope`. You can then start 25 asynchronous tasks (one per request) and wait
   for all of them to complete.

2. You can now add data to your application. Add the definition for a `mainScope`, and change your `App` component
   so it starts with the following snippet. Don't forget to replace demo values with `emptyLists` instances as well:

   ```kotlin
   val mainScope = MainScope()
   
   val App = FC<Props> {
       var currentVideo: Video? by useState(null)
       var unwatchedVideos: List<Video> by useState(emptyList())
       var watchedVideos: List<Video> by useState(emptyList())
   
       useEffectOnce {
           mainScope.launch {
               unwatchedVideos = fetchVideos()
           }
       }

   // . . .
   ```
   {validate="false"}

   * The [`MainScope()`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-main-scope.html)
     is a part of Kotlin's structured concurrency model and creates the scope for asynchronous tasks to run in.
   * `useEffectOnce` is another React _hook_ (specifically, a simplified version of the [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) hook).
     It indicates that the component performs a _side effect_. It doesn't just render itself but also communicates over
     the network.

Check your browser. The application should show actual data:

![Fetched data from API](website-api-data.png){width=700}

When you load the page:

* The code of the `App` component will be invoked. This starts the code in the `useEffectOnce` block.
* The `App` component is rendered with empty lists for the watched and unwatched videos.
* When the API requests finish, the `useEffectOnce` block assigns it to the `App` component's state. This triggers
  a re-render.
* The code of the `App` component will be invoked again, but the `useEffectOnce` block _will not_ run for a second time.

## Deploy to production and the cloud

It's time to get the application published to the cloud and make it accessible to other people.

### Package a production build

To package all assets in production mode, run the `build` task in Gradle via the tool window in IntelliJ IDEA or by
running `./gradlew build`. This generates an optimized project build, applying various improvements such as DCE
(dead code elimination).

Once the build has finished, you can find all the files needed for deployment in `/build/dist`. They include
the JavaScript files, HTML files, and other resources required to run the application. You can put them on a static HTTP server,
serve them using GitHub Pages, or host them on a cloud provider of your choice.

### Deploy to Heroku

Heroku makes it quite simple to spin up an application that is reachable under its own domain. Their free tier should be
sufficient for development purposes.

1. [Create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/).
2. [Install and authenticate the CLI client](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
3. Create a Git repository and attach a Heroku app by running the following commands in the Terminal while in the project
   root:

   ```bash
   git init
   heroku create
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```

4. Unlike a regular JVM application that would run on Heroku (one written with Ktor or Spring Boot, for example), your app
   generates static HTML pages and JavaScript files that need to be served accordingly. You can adjust the required
   buildpacks to serve the program properly:

   ```bash
   heroku buildpacks:set heroku/gradle
   heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git
   ```

5. To allow the `heroku/gradle` buildpack to run properly, a `stage` task needs to be in the `build.gradle.kts` file.
   This task is equivalent to the `build` task, and the corresponding alias is already included at the bottom of the file:

   ```kotlin
   // Heroku Deployment
   tasks.register("stage") {
       dependsOn("build")
   }
   ```

6. Add a new `static.json` file to the project root to configure the `buildpack-static`.
7. Add the `root` property inside the file:

   ```xml
   {
       "root": "build/distributions"
   }
   ```
   {validate="false"}

8. You can now trigger a deployment, for example, by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "add stage task and static content root configuration"
   git push heroku master
   ```

> If you're pushing from a non-main branch, adjust the command to push to the `main` remote, for example, `git push heroku feature-branch:main`.
>
{style="tip"}

If the deployment is successful, you will see the URL people can use to reach the application on the internet.

![Web app deployment to production](deployment-to-production.png){width=700}

> You can find this state of the project on the `finished` branch [here](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle/tree/finished).
>
{style="note"}

## What's next

### Add more features {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

You can use the resulting app as a jumping-off point to explore more advanced topics in the realm of React, Kotlin/JS, and more.

* **Search**. You can add a search field to filter the list of talks â€“ by title or by author, for example. Learn
  about how [HTML form elements work in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).
* **Persistence**. Currently, the application loses track of the viewer's watch list every time the page gets reloaded.
  Consider building your own backend, using one of the web frameworks available for Kotlin (such as [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)).
  Alternatively, look into ways to [store information on the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
* **Complex APIs**. Lots of datasets and APIs are available. You can pull all sorts of data into your application. For example,
  you can build a visualizer for [cat photos](https://thecatapi.com/) or a [royalty-free stock photo API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

### Improve the style: responsiveness and grids {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

The application design is still very simple and won't look great on mobile devices or in narrow windows. Explore
more of the CSS DSL to make the app more accessible.

### Join the community and get help {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

The best way to report problems and get help is the [kotlin-wrappers issue tracker](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/issues).
If you can't find a ticket for your issue, feel free to file a new one. You can also join the official [Kotlin Slack](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up).
There are channels for `#javascript` and `#react`.

### Learn more about coroutines {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

If you're interested in finding out more about how you can write concurrent code, check out the tutorial on [coroutines](coroutines-and-channels.md).

### Learn more about React {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

Now that you know the basic React concepts and how they translate to Kotlin, you can convert some other concepts outlined
in [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn) into Kotlin.
