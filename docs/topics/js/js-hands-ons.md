[//]: # (title: Hands-on labs for Kotlin/JS)

Hands-on labs are long-form tutorials that help you get to know a technology by guiding you through 
a self-contained project related to a specific topic. 

They include sample projects, which can serve as jumping-off points for your own projects, and contain useful snippets and patterns.

For Kotlin/JS, the following hands-on labs are currently available:

* [Building Web Applications with React and Kotlin/JS](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/) 
guides you through the process of building a simple web application
 using the React framework, shows how a typesafe Kotlin DSL for HTML makes it convenient to build reactive DOM elements, 
 and illustrates how to use third-party React components, and how to obtain information from APIs, 
 while writing the whole application logic in pure Kotlin/JS.
* [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/) 
teaches the concepts behind building an application that targets Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS by building a client-server application 
that makes use of common code, serialization, and other multiplatform paradigms. 
It also provides a brief introduction into working with Ktor both as a server- and client-side framework.

We are continuously working on expanding the set of hands-on labs to make it as easy as possible for you to learn more about Kotlin/JS and adjacent technologies.
