[//]: # (title: Kotlin/JavaScript)

Kotlin/JavaScript (Kotlin/JS) lets you transpile your Kotlin code, the Kotlin standard library, and any compatible dependencies
to JavaScript. This way, your Kotlin applications can run in any environment that supports JavaScript.

Use Kotlin/JS through the [Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-dsl-reference.html) (`kotlin.multiplatform`) to configure and manage 
Kotlin projects targeting JavaScript from a single place.

The Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin gives you access to features
such as controlling your application's bundling and adding JavaScript dependencies directly from npm.
To get an overview of the available configuration options, see [Set up a Kotlin/JS project](js-project-setup.md).

> The current implementation of Kotlin/JS targets the [ES5](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) and [ES2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/) standards.

## Use cases for Kotlin/JS

Here are some common ways to use Kotlin/JS:

*  **Sharing common logic between frontend and JVM backend**

   If your backend is written in Kotlin or another JVM-compatible language,
      you can share common code between your web application and the backend.
      This includes data-transfer objects (DTOs), validation and authentication rules, abstractions for REST API endpoints, and more.

*  **Sharing common logic between Android, iOS, and web clients**

   You can share business logic between your web interface and mobile applications for Android and iOS, 
   while keeping native user interfaces. This avoids duplicating common functionality such as REST API abstractions, 
   user authentication, form validation,
     and domain models.

* **Building frontend web applications using Kotlin/JS**

     Use Kotlin to develop traditional web frontends while integrating with existing tools and libraries:

     * If you are familiar with Android development, you can build web applications with
       Compose-based frameworks like [Kobweb](https://kobweb.varabyte.com/) or [Kilua](https://kilua.dev/).
     * Build fully type-safe React applications with Kotlin/JS using the [Kotlin wrappers for common JavaScript libraries](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers)
       provided by JetBrains. The Kotlin wrappers (`kotlin-wrappers`) offer abstractions and integrations for React and other JavaScript frameworks.
       
       These wrappers also support complementary libraries, like
       [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). 
       You can also use third-party React components and component libraries through interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem.
  
     * Use [Kotlin/JS frameworks](js-frameworks.md),
       which integrate with the Kotlin ecosystem and support concise and expressive code.

*  **Building multiplatform applications that support older browsers**

      With Compose Multiplatform, you can use Kotlin to build applications and reuse mobile and desktop user interfaces in your web projects.
      While [Kotlin/Wasm](wasm-overview.md) is the primary target for this purpose, you can extend support to older browsers by also targeting Kotlin/JS.

* **Building server-side and serverless applications using Kotlin/JS**

  The Node.js target in Kotlin/JS lets you create applications for server-side or serverless environments on a JavaScript 
  runtime. This offers a fast startup and low memory usage. The [`kotlinx-nodejs`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-nodejs) library
    provides type-safe access to the [Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) from Kotlin.

Depending on your use case, Kotlin/JS projects can use compatible libraries from the Kotlin ecosystem and 
third-party libraries from the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems. 

To use third-party libraries from your Kotlin code, you can create your own type-safe wrappers or use community-maintained wrappers. 
Additionally, you can use the Kotlin/JS [dynamic type](dynamic-type.md), which lets you skip strict typing and library wrappers, at the cost of type safety.

Kotlin/JS is also compatible with the most common module systems: [ESM](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules), [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules), 
[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api).
This allows you to [produce and consume modules](js-modules.md) and integrate with the JavaScript ecosystem in a structured manner.
