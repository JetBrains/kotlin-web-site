[//]: # (title: Null safety)

Null safety is a Kotlin feature designed to eliminate the danger of null references, also known as [The Billion-Dollar Mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#History).

One of the most common pitfalls in many programming languages, including Java, is that accessing a member of a null
reference will result in a null reference exception. In Java, this would be the equivalent of a `NullPointerException`,
or an _NPE_ for short.

Kotlin explicitly supports nullability as part of its type system, meaning you can explicitly declare 
which variables or properties are allowed to be `null`. Also, when you declare non-null variables, the compiler 
enforces that these variables cannot hold a `null` value,
preventing an NPE. 

Kotlin's null safety ensures safer code by catching potential null-related issues at compile time rather than runtime. 
This feature enhances code robustness, readability, and maintainability by explicitly expressing `null` values, making the code easier to understand and manage.

Thanks to null safety, the only possible causes of an NPE in Kotlin are:

* An explicit call to `throw NullPointerException()`
* Usage of the [`!!` operator](#not-null-assertion-operator)
* Data inconsistency concerning initialization, such as when:
  * An uninitialized `this` available in a constructor is passed and used somewhere ([a "leaking `this`"](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-9751))
  * A [superclass constructor calls an open member](inheritance.md#derived-class-initialization-order) whose implementation
    in the derived class uses an uninitialized state
* Java interoperation:
  * Attempts to access a member of a `null` reference of a [platform type](java-interop.md#null-safety-and-platform-types)
  * Nullability issues with generic types for Java interoperation. For example, a piece of Java code might add
    `null` into a Kotlin `MutableList<String>`, therefore requiring a `MutableList<String?>` for working with it
  * Other issues caused by external Java code

> Besides NPE, another exception related to null safety is `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`. Kotlin throws this exception 
> when you try to access a property that has not been initialized, ensuring that non-nullable properties are not used until they are ready. 
> This typically happens with [`lateinit` properties](properties.md#late-initialized-properties-and-variables).

## Nullable types and non-nullable types

In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between types that can hold `null` (nullable types) and those that
cannot (non-nullable types). For example, a regular variable of type `String` cannot hold `null`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a non-null string to a variable
    var a: String = "abc"
    // Re-assigns null to the non-nullable variable
    a = null
    print(a)
    // Null can not be a value of a non-null type String
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" validate="false"}

You can safely call a method or access a property on `a`. It's guaranteed not to cause an NPE because `a` is a non-nullable variable.
The compiler ensures that `a` always holds a valid `String` value, and there's no risk of accessing its properties or methods when it's `null`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a non-null string to a variable
    val a: String = "abc"
    // Returns the length of a non-nullable variable
    val l = a.length
    print(l)
    // 3
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" validate="false"}

To allow nulls, declare a variable with a `?` sign right after the variable type. For example, 
declare a nullable string by writing `String?`. This expression makes `String` a type that
can accept nullables:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a nullable string to a variable
    var b: String? = "abc"
    // Re-assigns null to the nullable variable
    b = null
    print(b)
    // null
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

If you want to access `length` on `b`, the compiler reports an error. This is because `b` is declared as a nullable
variable and can hold `null` values. Trying to directly access properties on nullables leads to an NPE:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a nullable string to a variable  
    var b: String? = "abc"
    // Re-assigns null to the nullable variable
    b = null
    // Tries to directly return the length of a nullable variable
    val l = b.length
    print(l)
    // Only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type String? 
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.0" validate="false"}

In the code above, the compiler requires you to use safe calls to check for nullability and then access properties or 
perform operations. There are a few ways to check for nullability.

## Checking for `null` with the `if` conditional

When working with nullable types, you need to handle nullability safely to avoid an NPE. One alternative is to 
check for nullability explicitly with the `if` conditional expression. 

For example, check whether `b` is `null` and then access `b.length`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns null to a nullable variable
    val b: String? = null
    // Checks for nullability first and then accesses length
    val l = if (b != null) b.length else -1
    print(l)
    // -1
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

The compiler performs [smart casts](typecasts.md#smart-casts) to change the type from `String?` to `String`. It also tracks the information about 
the check you performed and allows the call to `length` inside the `if` conditional.

More complex conditions are supported as well:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a nullable string to a variable  
    val b: String? = "Kotlin"

    // Checks for nullability first and then accesses length
    if (b != null && b.length > 0) {
        print("String of length ${b.length}")
    // Provides alternative if the condition is not met  
    } else {
        print("Empty string")
        // String of length 6
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

Note that the example above only works when the compiler can guarantee that `b` won't change between the check and its usage, same as 
the [smart cast prerequisites](typecasts.md#smart-cast-prerequisites).

## Safe call operator (`?.`)

The safe call operator (`?.`) allows you to handle nullability safely in a shorter form. Instead of throwing an NPE, 
if the object is `null`, the `?` operator simply returns `null`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a nullable string to a variable  
    val a: String? = "Kotlin"
    // Assigns null to a nullable variable
    val b: String? = null
    // Checks for nullability and returns length or null
    println(a?.length)
    // 6
    println(b?.length)
    // null
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

The `b?.length` expression checks for nullability and returns `b.length` if `b` is not null or `null` otherwise. The type of this expression is `Int?`.

You can use the `?.` operator with both [`var` and `val` variables](basic-syntax.md#variables) in Kotlin:

* **`var`:** If you declare it as nullable (for example, `var nullableValue: String?`), it can hold a null or non-null value, and you can change it to `null` at any point.
* **`val`:** If you declare it as nullable (for example, `val nullableValue: String?`), it can hold a null or non-null value, but you can't change it subsequently.

Safe calls are useful in chains. For example, Bob is an employee who may be assigned to a department (or not). That department
may, in turn, have another employee as a department head. To obtain the name of Bob's department head (if there is one),
you write the following:

```kotlin
bob?.department?.head?.name
```

Such a chain returns `null` if any of its properties are `null`. Here's the equivalent of the same safe call but with the `if` conditional:

```kotlin
if (person != null && person.department != null) {
    person.department.head = managersPool.getManager()
}
```

You can also place a safe call on the left side of an assignment. Then, if one of the receivers in the safe calls chain
is `null`, the assignment is skipped, and the expression on the right is not evaluated at all. For example, if either 
`person` or `person.department` is null, the function is not called:

```kotlin
person?.department?.head = managersPool.getManager()
```

## Elvis operator (`?:`)

When you have a nullable type, you can check for `null` and provide an alternative value. For example, if `b` is not `null`,
access `b.length`. Otherwise, use some non-null value:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns null to a nullable variable  
    val b: String? = null
    // Checks for nullability. If not null, returns length. If null, returns a non-null value
    val l: Int = if (b != null) b.length else 0
    println(l)
    // 0
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

Instead of writing the complete `if` expression, you can also express this in a shorter manner with the Elvis operator (`?:`):

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns null to a nullable variable  
    val b: String? = null
    // Checks for nullability. If not null, returns length. If null, returns a non-null value
    val l = b?.length ?: 0
    println(l)
    // 0
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

If the expression to the left of `?:` is not `null`, the Elvis operator returns it. Otherwise, the Elvis operator returns the expression
to the right. The expression on the right-hand side is evaluated only if the left-hand side is `null`.

Since `throw` and `return` are expressions in Kotlin, you can also use them on
the right-hand side of the Elvis operator. This can be handy, for example, when checking function arguments:

```kotlin
fun foo(node: Node): String? {
    // Checks for getParent(). If not null, it's assigned to parent. If null, returns null
    val parent = node.getParent() ?: return null
    // Checks for getName(). If not null, it's assigned to name. If null, throws exception
    val name = node.getName() ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("name expected")
    // ...
}
```

## Not-null assertion operator (`!!`)

The not-null assertion operator (`!!`) converts any value to a non-nullable type.

When you apply the `!!` operator to a variable whose value is not `null`, it's safely handled as a non-nullable type, 
and the code executes normally. However, if the value is `null`, the `!!` operator forces it to be treated as non-nullable, 
which results in an exception.

When `b` is not null and the `!!` operator makes it return its non-null value (which is a `String` in this example), it accesses `length` correctly:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns a nullable string to a variable  
    val b: String? = "Kotlin"
    // Treats b as non-null and accesses its length
    val l = b!!.length
    println(l)
    // 6
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

When `b` is null and the `!!` operator makes it return its non-null value, and an NPE occurs:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Assigns null to a nullable variable  
    val b: String? = null
    // Treats b as non-null and tries to access its length
    val l = b!!.length
    println(l) 
    // Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="2.0" validate="false"}

Thus, if you expect an NPE, you can have the `!!` operator, but you have to ask for it explicitly.

## Nullable receiver

You can use extension functions with a [nullable receiver type](extensions.md#nullable-receiver). This means the 
function can be called on variables that might be null.

By defining an extension function on a nullable receiver type, you can handle null values within the function itself 
instead of checking for null at every place where you call the function.

For example, the [`toString()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to-string.html) extension function 
can be called on a nullable receiver. When invoked on a null value, it safely returns the string "null" without throwing an exception:

```kotlin
// SampleStart
fun main() {
    // Assigns null to a nullable Person object stored in the person variable
    val person: Person? = null

    // Applies toString to the nullable person variable and prints a string
    println(person.toString())
    // null
}

// Defines a simple Person class
data class Person(val name: String)
// SampleEnd
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

In the example above, even though `person` is `null`, the `toString()` function safely returns the string "null". This can be helpful in situations like debugging and logging.

If you expect the `toString()` function to return a nullable string (either a string representation or null), use the [safe-call operator (`?.`)](#safe-call-operator).
This operator checks if the receiver is `null`. If so, the `?.` operator doesn't invoke the `toString()` function and the code returns `null`, preventing exceptions. Otherwise, the code prints the result of the `toString()` function:

```kotlin
// SampleStart
fun main() {
    // Assigns a nullable Person object to a variable
    val person1: Person? = null
    val person2: Person? = Person("Alice")

    // Prints "null" if person is null; otherwise prints the result of person.toString()
    println(person1?.toString())
    // null
    println(person2?.toString())
    // Person(name=Alice)
}

// Defines a Person class
data class Person(val name: String)
// SampleEnd
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

The `?.` operator allows you to safely handle potential null values while still accessing properties or methods of objects that might be null.

## Let function

To handle null values and perform operations only on non-null types, you can use the safe call operator (`?`) together with the
[`let` function](scope-functions.md#let). 

They are useful to evaluate an expression, check the result for null, and execute code only if it's not null, avoiding manual null checks:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    // Declares a list of nullable strings
    val listWithNulls: List<String?> = listOf("Kotlin", null)

    // Iterates over each item in the list
    for (item in listWithNulls) {
        // Checks if the item is null and only prints non-null values
        item?.let { println(it) }
        //Kotlin 
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

## Safe casts (`as?`)

The regular Kotlin operator for [type casts](typecasts.md#unsafe-cast-operator) is the `as` operator. However, regular casts may result in an exception
if the object is not of the target type. 

The `as?` operator is the option to use safe casts. It tries to cast a value to the specified type and returns `null` if the value doesn't have the proper type:

```kotlin
fun main() {
// SampleStart
    // Declares a variable of type Any, which can hold any type of value
    val a: Any = "Hello, Kotlin!"

    // Safe casts to Int using the 'as?' operator
    val aInt: Int? = a as? Int
    // Safe casts to String using the 'as?' operator
    val aString: String? = a as? String

    println(aInt)
    // null
    println(aString)
    // "Hello, Kotlin!"
// SampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

The code above prints `null` because `a` is not an `Int`, so the cast fails safely. It also prints
"Hello, Kotlin!" because it matches the `String?` type, so the safe cast succeeds.

## Collections of a nullable type

If you have a collection of elements of a nullable type and want to filter non-nullable elements, use
the `filterNotNull()` function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // SampleStart
    // Declares a list containing some null and non-null integer values
    val nullableList: List<Int?> = listOf(1, 2, null, 4)

    // Filters out null values, resulting in a list of non-null integers
    val intList: List<Int> = nullableList.filterNotNull()
  
    println(intList)
    // [1, 2, 4]
    // SampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}
