[//]: # (title: Grouping)

The Kotlin standard library provides extension functions for grouping collection elements.
The basic function [`groupBy()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/group-by.html) takes a
lambda function and returns a `Map`. In this map, each key is the lambda result and the corresponding value is the `List`
of elements on which this result is returned. This function can be used, for example, to group a list of `String`s by
their first letter. 

You can also call `groupBy()` with a second lambda argument â€“ a value transformation function.
In the result map of `groupBy()` with two lambdas, the keys produced by `keySelector` function are mapped to the results
of the value transformation function instead of the original elements.

```kotlin

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = listOf("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")

    println(numbers.groupBy { it.first().uppercase() })
    println(numbers.groupBy(keySelector = { it.first() }, valueTransform = { it.uppercase() }))
//sampleEnd
}
```

If you want to group elements and then apply an operation to all groups at one time, use the function [`groupingBy()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/grouping-by.html).
It returns an instance of the [`Grouping`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-grouping/index.html)
type. The `Grouping` instance lets you apply operations to all groups in a lazy manner: the groups are actually built
right before the operation execution.

Namely, `Grouping` supports the following operations:

* [`eachCount()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/each-count.html) counts the elements in each group. 
* [`fold()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/fold.html) and [`reduce()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/reduce.html)
   perform [fold and reduce](collection-aggregate.md#fold-and-reduce) operations on each group as a separate collection
   and return the results.
* [`aggregate()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/aggregate.html) applies a given operation
   subsequently to all the elements in each group and returns the result.
   This is the generic way to perform any operations on a `Grouping`. Use it to implement custom operations when fold or reduce are not enough.

```kotlin

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = listOf("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six")
    println(numbers.groupingBy { it.first() }.eachCount())
//sampleEnd
}
```
