[//]: # (title: Kotlin Koans)

Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax.
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass.
You can work with Kotlin Koans in one of following two ways:

1. You can play with [Koans online](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans).

2. You can perform the tasks right inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio by [installing the EduTools plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html) and [choosing Kotlin Koans course](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans).

Whatever way you choose to solve koans, you can see the solution for each task: in the online version click on "Show answer", inside EduTools plugin choose "Peek solution". We recommend checking the solution after you implement the task to compare your solution with the proposed one. Make sure you don't cheat!
