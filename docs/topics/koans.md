[//]: # (title: Kotlin Koans)

Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises designed primarily for Java developers, to help you become familiar with the Kotlin syntax.
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test, and your job is to make it pass.
You can complete the Kotlin Koans tasks in one of the following ways:

* You can play with [Koans online](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans).
* You can perform the tasks right inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio by [installing the JetBrains Academy plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-jetbrains-academy/docs/install-jetbrains-academy-plugin.html)
  and [choosing the Kotlin Koans course](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-jetbrains-academy/docs/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans).

Whatever way you choose to solve koans, you can see the solution for each task:
* In the online version, click **Show answer**.
* For the JetBrains Academy plugin, try to complete the task first and then choose **Peek solution** if your answer is 
  incorrect.

We recommend you check the solution after implementing the task to compare your answer with the proposed one.
Make sure you don't cheat!
