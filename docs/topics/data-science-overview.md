[//]: # (title: Kotlin for data analysis)

From building data pipelines to productionizing machine learning models, Kotlin can be a great choice for 
working with data:
* Kotlin is concise, readable, and easy to learn.
* Static typing and null safety help create reliable, maintainable code that is easy to troubleshoot. 
* Kotlin has 100% interoperability with Java, providing excellent performance and the ability to leverage the entire ecosystem of tried and true Java libraries.

## Notebooks

_Notebooks_ are interactive editors. Notebooks such as [Kotlin Notebook](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16340-kotlin-notebook),
[Datalore](http://jetbrains.com/datalore)and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), 
provide convenient tools for data visualization and exploratory research.

Kotlin integrates with these tools to help you explore data, share your findings with 
colleagues, or build up your data science and machine learning skills.

### Kotlin Notebook

The [Kotlin Notebook](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16340-kotlin-notebook) is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that
allows you to create notebooks in Kotlin. It leverages the [Kotlin kernel](#jupyter-notebooks-with-kotlin-kernel) for executing the
cells and harnesses the powerful Kotlin IDE support to offer real-time code insights. Kotlin Notebook is the preferred method
for working with Kotlin notebooks.

### Kotlin notebooks in Datalore

With Datalore, you can use Kotlin in the browser straight out of the box, no installation required.
You can also collaborate on Kotlin notebooks in real time,
get smart coding assistance when writing code, and share results as interactive or static reports.

Check out a [sample report](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/view/report/9YLrg20eesVX2cQu1FKLiZ).

### Jupyter Notebooks with Kotlin kernel

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application
that allows you to create and share documents that can contain code,
visualizations, and Markdown text. 
[Kotlin-jupyter](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) is an open source project that brings Kotlin 
support to Jupyter Notebook.

instructions, documentation, and examples.
