[//]: # (title: KUG guidelines)

A Kotlin User Group, or KUG, is a community that is dedicated to Kotlin and that offers you a place to share your
Kotlin programming experience with like-minded people.

To become a KUG, your community should have some specific features shared by every KUG. It should:
* Provide Kotlin-related content, with regular meetups as the main form of activity.
* Host regular events (at least once every 3 months) with open registration and without any restriction for attendance.
* Be driven and organized by the community, and it should not use events to earn money or gain any other business
  benefits from members and attendees.
* Follow and ensure a code of conduct to provide a welcoming environment for attendees of any background and
  experience (check out our recommended [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jetbrains#code-of-conduct)).

There are no limits regarding the format for KUG meetups. They can take place in whatever fashion works best for the
community, whether that includes presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers.

## How to run a KUG?

* To promote group cohesion and prevent miscommunication, we recommend keeping to a limit of one KUG per city. 
  Check out [the list of KUGs](https://kotlinlang.org/community/user-groups/) to see if there is already a KUG in your area.
* Use the official KUG logo and branding. Check out [the branding guidelines](kotlin-brand-assets.md#kotlin-user-group-brand-assets).
* Keep your user group active. Run meetups regularly, at least once every 3 months.
* Announce your KUG meetups at least 2 weeks in advance. The announcement should contain a list of talks
  and the names of the speakers, as well as the location, timing, and any other crucial info about the event.
* KUG events should be free or, if you need to cover organizing expenses, limit prices to a maximum of 10 USD.
* Your group should have a code of conduct available for all members.

If your community has all the necessary features and follows these guidelines, you are ready to [Apply to be a new
