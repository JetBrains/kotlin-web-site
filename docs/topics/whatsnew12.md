## Multiplatform projects (experimental)

Multiplatform projects are a new **experimental** feature in Kotlin 1.2, allowing you to reuse code between target platforms
supported by Kotlin – JVM, JavaScript, and (in the future) Native. In a multiplatform project, you have three kinds of modules:

* A *common* module contains code that is not specific to any platform, as well as declarations without implementation of platform-dependent APIs.
* A *platform* module contains implementations of platform-dependent declarations in the common module for a specific platform, as well as other platform-dependent code.
* A regular module targets a specific platform and can either be a dependency of platform modules or depend on platform modules.

When you compile a multiplatform project for a specific platform, the code for both the common and platform-specific parts is generated.

A key feature of the multiplatform project support is the possibility to express dependencies of common code on platform-specific
parts through *expected* and *actual* declarations. An *expected* declaration specifies an API (class, interface, annotation, top-level declaration etc.).
An *actual* declaration is either a platform-dependent implementation of the API or a typealias referring to an existing
implementation of the API in an external library. Here's an example:

In the common code:

```kotlin
// expected platform-specific API:
expect fun hello(world: String): String

fun greet() {
    // usage of the expected API:
    val greeting = hello("multiplatform world")
    println(greeting)
}

expect class URL(spec: String) {
    open fun getHost(): String
    open fun getPath(): String
}
```

In the JVM platform code:

```kotlin
actual fun hello(world: String): String =
    "Hello, $world, on the JVM platform!"

// using existing platform-specific implementation:
actual typealias URL = java.net.URL
```

See the [multiplatform programming documentation](multiplatform.md) for details and steps to build a multiplatform project.

## Other language features

### Array literals in annotations

Starting with Kotlin 1.2, array arguments for annotations can be passed with the new array literal syntax instead 
of the `arrayOf` function:

```kotlin
@CacheConfig(cacheNames = ["books", "default"])
public class BookRepositoryImpl {
    // ...
}
```

The array literal syntax is constrained to annotation arguments.

### Lateinit top-level properties and local variables

The `lateinit` modifier can now be used on top-level properties and local variables. The latter can be used, 
for example, when a lambda passed as a constructor argument to one object refers to another object 
which has to be defined later:

```kotlin
class Node<T>(val value: T, val next: () -> Node<T>)

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    // A cycle of three nodes:
    lateinit var third: Node<Int>

    val second = Node(2, next = { third })
    val first = Node(1, next = { second })

    third = Node(3, next = { first })

    val nodes = generateSequence(first) { it.next() }
    println("Values in the cycle: ${nodes.take(7).joinToString { it.value.toString() }}, ...")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Check whether a lateinit var is initialized

You can now check whether a lateinit var has been initialized using `isInitialized` on the property reference:

```kotlin
class Foo {
    lateinit var lateinitVar: String

    fun initializationLogic() {
//sampleStart
        println("isInitialized before assignment: " + this::lateinitVar.isInitialized)
        lateinitVar = "value"
        println("isInitialized after assignment: " + this::lateinitVar.isInitialized)
//sampleEnd
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	Foo().initializationLogic()
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Inline functions with default functional parameters

Inline functions are now allowed to have default values for their inlined functional parameters:

```kotlin
//sampleStart
inline fun <E> Iterable<E>.strings(transform: (E) -> String = { it.toString() }) =
    map { transform(it) }

val defaultStrings = listOf(1, 2, 3).strings()
val customStrings = listOf(1, 2, 3).strings { "($it)" } 
//sampleEnd

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("defaultStrings = $defaultStrings")
    println("customStrings = $customStrings")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Information from explicit casts is used for type inference

The Kotlin compiler can now use information from type casts in type inference. If you’re calling a generic method
that returns a type parameter `T` and casting the return value to a specific type `Foo`, the compiler now understands
that `T` for this call needs to be bound to the type `Foo`.

This is particularly important for Android developers, since the compiler can now correctly analyze generic
`findViewById` calls in Android API level 26:

```kotlin
val button = findViewById(R.id.button) as Button
```

### Smart cast improvements

When a variable is assigned from a safe call expression and checked for null, the smart cast is now applied to
the safe call receiver as well:

```kotlin
fun countFirst(s: Any): Int {
//sampleStart
    val firstChar = (s as? CharSequence)?.firstOrNull()
    if (firstChar != null)
    return s.count { it == firstChar } // s: Any is smart cast to CharSequence

    val firstItem = (s as? Iterable<*>)?.firstOrNull()
    if (firstItem != null)
    return s.count { it == firstItem } // s: Any is smart cast to Iterable<*>
//sampleEnd
    return -1
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  val string = "abacaba"
  val countInString = countFirst(string)
  println("called on \"$string\": $countInString")

  val list = listOf(1, 2, 3, 1, 2)
  val countInList = countFirst(list)
  println("called on $list: $countInList")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Also, smart casts in a lambda are now allowed for local variables that are only modified before the lambda:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
    val flag = args.size == 0
    var x: String? = null
    if (flag) x = "Yahoo!"

    run {
        if (x != null) {
            println(x.length) // x is smart cast to String
        }
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Support for  ::foo as a shorthand for this::foo

A bound callable reference to a member of `this` can now be written without explicit receiver, `::foo` instead
of `this::foo`. This also makes callable references more convenient to use in lambdas where you refer to a member
of the outer receiver.

### Breaking change: sound smart casts after try blocks

Earlier, Kotlin used assignments made inside a `try` block for smart casts after the block, which could break type- and null-safety
and lead to runtime failures. This release fixes this issue, making the smart casts more strict, but breaking some code
that relied on such smart casts.

To switch to the old smart casts behavior, pass the fallback flag `-Xlegacy-smart-cast-after-try` as the compiler
argument. It will become deprecated in Kotlin 1.3.

### Deprecation: data classes overriding copy

When a data class derived from a type that already had the `copy` function with the same signature, the `copy`
implementation generated for the data class used the defaults from the supertype, leading to counter-intuitive behavior,
or failed at runtime if there were no default parameters in the supertype.

Inheritance that leads to a `copy` conflict has become deprecated with a warning in Kotlin 1.2
and will be an error in Kotlin 1.3.

### Deprecation: nested types in enum entries

Inside enum entries, defining a nested type that is not an `inner class` has been deprecated due to issues in the
initialization logic. This causes a warning in Kotlin 1.2 and will become an error in Kotlin 1.3.

### Deprecation: single named argument for vararg

For consistency with array literals in annotations, passing a single item for a vararg parameter in the named
form (`foo(items = i)`) has been deprecated. Please use the spread operator with the corresponding
array factory functions:

```kotlin
foo(items = *intArrayOf(1))
```

There is an optimization that removes redundant arrays creation in such cases, which prevents performance degradation.
The single-argument form produces warnings in Kotlin 1.2 and is to be dropped in Kotlin 1.3.

### Deprecation: inner classes of generic classes extending Throwable

Inner classes of generic types that inherit from `Throwable` could violate type-safety in a throw-catch scenario and
thus have been deprecated, with a warning in Kotlin 1.2 and an error in Kotlin 1.3.

### Deprecation: mutating backing field of a read-only property

Mutating the backing field of a read-only property by assigning `field = ...` in the custom getter has been
deprecated, with a warning in Kotlin 1.2 and an error in Kotlin 1.3.

## Standard library

### Kotlin standard library artifacts and split packages

The Kotlin standard library is now fully compatible with the Java 9 module system, which forbids split packages
(multiple jar files declaring classes in the same package). In order to support that, new artifacts `kotlin-stdlib-jdk7`
and `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` are introduced, which replace the old `kotlin-stdlib-jre7` and `kotlin-stdlib-jre8`.

The declarations in the new artifacts are visible under the same package names from the Kotlin point of view, but have
different package names for Java. Therefore, switching to the new artifacts will not require any changes to
your source code.

Another change made to ensure compatibility with the new module system is removing the deprecated
declarations in the `kotlin.reflect` package from the `kotlin-reflect` library. If you were using them, you need
to switch to using the declarations in the `kotlin.reflect.full` package, which is supported since Kotlin 1.1.

### windowed, chunked, zipWithNext

New extensions for `Iterable<T>`, `Sequence<T>`, and `CharSequence` cover such use cases as buffering or
batch processing (`chunked`), sliding window and computing sliding average (`windowed`) , and processing pairs
of subsequent items (`zipWithNext`):

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
    val items = (1..9).map { it * it }

    val chunkedIntoLists = items.chunked(4)
    val points3d = items.chunked(3) { (x, y, z) -> Triple(x, y, z) }
    val windowed = items.windowed(4)
    val slidingAverage = items.windowed(4) { it.average() }
    val pairwiseDifferences = items.zipWithNext { a, b -> b - a }
//sampleEnd

    println("items: $items\n")

    println("chunked into lists: $chunkedIntoLists")
    println("3D points: $points3d")
    println("windowed by 4: $windowed")
    println("sliding average by 4: $slidingAverage")
    println("pairwise differences: $pairwiseDifferences")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### fill, replaceAll, shuffle/shuffled

A set of extension functions was added for manipulating lists: `fill`, `replaceAll` and `shuffle` for `MutableList`,
and `shuffled` for read-only `List`:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//sampleStart
    val items = (1..5).toMutableList()
    
    items.shuffle()
    println("Shuffled items: $items")
    
    items.replaceAll { it * 2 }
    println("Items doubled: $items")
    
    items.fill(5)
    println("Items filled with 5: $items")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Math operations in kotlin-stdlib

Satisfying the longstanding request, Kotlin 1.2 adds the `kotlin.math` API for math operations that is common 
for JVM and JS and contains the following:

* Constants: `PI` and `E`
* Trigonometric: `cos`, `sin`, `tan` and inverse of them: `acos`, `asin`, `atan`, `atan2`
* Hyperbolic: `cosh`, `sinh`, `tanh` and their inverse: `acosh`, `asinh`, `atanh`
* Exponentation: `pow` (an extension function), `sqrt`, `hypot`, `exp`, `expm1`
* Logarithms: `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `ln`, `ln1p`
* Rounding:
    * `ceil`, `floor`, `truncate`, `round` (half to even) functions
    * `roundToInt`, `roundToLong` (half to integer) extension functions
* Sign and absolute value:
    * `abs` and `sign` functions
    * `absoluteValue` and `sign` extension properties
    * `withSign` extension function
* `max` and `min` of two values
* Binary representation:
    * `ulp` extension property
    * `nextUp`, `nextDown`, `nextTowards` extension functions
    * `toBits`, `toRawBits`, `Double.fromBits` (these are in the `kotlin` package)

The same set of functions (but without constants) is also available for `Float` arguments.

### Operators and conversions for BigInteger and BigDecimal

Kotlin 1.2 introduces a set of functions for operating with `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` and creating them 
from other numeric types. These are:

* `toBigInteger` for `Int` and `Long`
* `toBigDecimal` for `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, and `BigInteger`
* Arithmetic and bitwise operator functions:
    * Binary operators  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` and infix functions `and`, `or`, `xor`, `shl`, `shr`
    * Unary operators `-`, `++`, `--`, and a function `inv`

### Floating point to bits conversions

New functions were added for converting `Double` and `Float` to and from their bit representations:

* `toBits` and `toRawBits` returning `Long` for `Double` and `Int` for `Float`
* `Double.fromBits` and `Float.fromBits` for creating floating point numbers from the bit representation

### Regex is now serializable

The `kotlin.text.Regex` class has become `Serializable` and can now be used in serializable hierarchies.

### Closeable.use calls Throwable.addSuppressed if available

The `Closeable.use` function calls `Throwable.addSuppressed` when an exception is thrown during closing the resource 
after some other exception. 

To enable this behavior you need to have `kotlin-stdlib-jdk7` in your dependencies.

## JVM backend

### Constructor calls normalization

Ever since version 1.0, Kotlin supported expressions with complex control flow, such as try-catch expressions and 
inline function calls. Such code is valid according to the Java Virtual Machine specification. Unfortunately, some 
bytecode processing tools do not handle such code quite well when such expressions are present in the arguments 
of constructor calls.

To mitigate this problem for the users of such bytecode processing tools, we’ve added a command-line compiler
option (`-Xnormalize-constructor-calls=MODE`) that tells the compiler to generate more Java-like bytecode for such 
constructs. Here `MODE` is one of:

* `disable` (default) – generate bytecode in the same way as in Kotlin 1.0 and 1.1.
* `enable` – generate Java-like bytecode for constructor calls. This can change the order in which the classes are 
 loaded and initialized.
* `preserve-class-initialization` – generate Java-like bytecode for constructor calls, ensuring that the class 
initialization order is preserved. This can affect overall performance of your application; use it only if you have 
some complex state shared between multiple classes and updated on class initialization.

The “manual” workaround is to store the values of sub-expressions with control flow in variables, instead of 
evaluating them directly inside the call arguments. It’s similar to `-Xnormalize-constructor-calls=enable`.

### Java-default method calls 

Before Kotlin 1.2, interface members overriding Java-default methods while targeting JVM 1.6 produced a warning on 
super calls: `Super calls to Java default methods are deprecated in JVM target 1.6. Recompile with '-jvm-target 1.8'`. 
In Kotlin 1.2, there's an **error** instead, thus requiring any such code to be compiled with JVM target 1.8.

### Breaking change: consistent behavior of x.equals(null) for platform types

Calling `x.equals(null)` on a platform type that is mapped to a Java primitive 
(`Int!`, `Boolean!`, `Short`!, `Long!`, `Float!`, `Double!`, `Char!`) incorrectly returned `true` when `x` was null. 
Starting with Kotlin 1.2, calling `x.equals(...)` on a null value of a platform type **throws an NPE** 
(but `x == ...` does not).

To return to the pre-1.2 behavior, pass the flag `-Xno-exception-on-explicit-equals-for-boxed-null` to the compiler.

### Breaking change: fix for platform null escaping through an inlined extension receiver

Inline extension functions that were called on a null value of a platform type did not check the receiver for null and 
would thus allow null to escape into the other code. Kotlin 1.2 forces this check at the call sites, throwing an exception
if the receiver is null.

To switch to the old behavior, pass the fallback flag `-Xno-receiver-assertions` to the compiler.

## JavaScript backend

### TypedArrays support enabled by default

The JS typed arrays support that translates Kotlin primitive arrays, such as `IntArray`, `DoubleArray`, 
into [JavaScript typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays), that was 
previously an opt-in feature, has been enabled by default.

## Tools

### Warnings as errors

The compiler now provides an option to treat all warnings as errors. Use `-Werror` on the command line, or the 
following Gradle snippet:

```groovy
compileKotlin {
    kotlinOptions.allWarningsAsErrors = true
}
```
