## Kotlin mascot

Meet the official Kotlin mascot. We use "they/them" when we speak about them.

They don’t have a name yet, but you can help us with it! [Submit your ideas](#name-choosing-after-choosing-it-will-be-just-name).

Even though we can’t say their name yet, we can definitely say a few things about them:
They are:
* Dynamic, motivated, and adventurous
* Rational and practical
* Can be a bit childish
* Open-minded and a bit hip
* Erudite, intelligent, curious, problem solver

### Name choosing

Let’s choose the name for the Kotlin mascot together. Submit your ideas to [this form](link to the form). We will pick the list of the most frequent ideas and make a vote to choose the best one, stay tuned!

### How to use the mascot

Use it everywhere you think it fits. We would be happy if you will use the mascot in your blogs, videos, swag, etc — everywhere you can imagine and even instead of the logo. Below you can find some ideas, but feel free to experiment!

### Kotlin logo

Our logo consists of a mark and a typeface. The full color version is the main one and should be used in the vast majority of cases.

![Kotlin logo](kotlin-logo.png){width=700}

full color version png svg ai  
monochrome version png svg ai  
single color version png svg ai  

Our logo and sign have a protective field. Please position the logo so that other design elements do not fall into the box. The minimum size of the protective field is half the height of the mark.

Pay special attention to the following logo misuse:

* Do not separate the mark from the text. Do not swap elements
* Do not change the transparency of the logo
* Do not outline the logo
* Do not repaint the logo in third-party colors
* Do not change the text
* Do not set the logo against a complex background. Do not place the logo in front of a bright background

### Font
We use JetBrains Sans in size 400 as our main corporate font.
The font was developed specifically for JetBrains by the designer Philipp Nurullin. It is the property of the company and requires a license to use.
When we cannot use our font we use Inter Regular. For example, in Google Slide presentations.

### Colors

Our style has three main colors:

* Blue as a display color. We apply it to important buttons on websites or to our logo in cases where the full color version cannot be used.
* Black for the dark theme. It is a priority theme. We apply this color to backgrounds and texts.
* White for the light theme. It is a secondary theme. We apply this color to backgrounds and texts.

Our style uses two types of gradient:
* A linear gradient for the logo and other style constants. It consists of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the gradient scale. Please do not change the sequence of colors on the scale.
* A gradient mesh for banner backgrounds. It consists of four colors equidistant from each other. Please do not make abrupt transitions between colors.
