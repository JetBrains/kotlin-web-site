[//]: # (title: Kotlin for Android)

Android mobile development has been [Kotlin-first](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first) since Google I/O in 2019.

Over 50% of professional Android developers use Kotlin as their primary language, while only 30% use Java as their
main language. 70% of developers whose primary language is Kotlin say that Kotlin makes them more productive.

Using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:

* **Less code combined with greater readability**. Spend less time writing your code and working to understand the code
  of others.
* **Fewer common errors**. Apps built with Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash based
  on [Google's internal data](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/fewer-crashes-and-more-stability-with-kotlin-b606c6a6ac04).
* **Kotlin support in Jetpack libraries**. [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android's
  recommended modern toolkit for building native UI in Kotlin.
  [KTX extensions](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) add Kotlin language features, like coroutines,
  extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters to existing Android libraries.
* **Support for multiplatform development**. Kotlin Multiplatform allows development for not only Android but
  also [iOS](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/), backend, and web applications.
  [Some Jetpack libraries](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform) are already multiplatform.
  [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), JetBrains' declarative UI framework
  based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, makes it possible to share UIs across platforms – iOS, Android, desktop, and web.
* **Mature language and environment**. Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has developed continuously, not only as a
  language but as a whole ecosystem with robust tooling. Now it's seamlessly integrated into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  and is actively used by many companies for developing Android applications.
* **Interoperability with Java**. You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming language in your applications
  without needing to migrate all your code to Kotlin.
* **Easy learning**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
* **Big community**. Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, which is growing all over the
  world. Over 95% of the top thousand Android apps use Kotlin.

Many startups and Fortune 500 companies have already developed Android applications using Kotlin, see the list
on [the Google website for Android developers](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/stories).

To start using Kotlin for:

* Android development, read [Google's documentation for developing Android apps with Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started).
* Developing cross-platform mobile applications, see [Create an app with shared logic and native UI](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-create-first-app.html).
