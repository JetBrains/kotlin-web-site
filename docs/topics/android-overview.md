[//]: # (title: Kotlin for Android)

Android mobile development has been Kotlin-first since Google I/O in 2019.

Using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:

* **Less code combined with greater readability**. Spend less time writing your code and working to understand the code of others.
* **Mature language and environment**. Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has developed continuously, not only as a language 
but as a whole ecosystem with robust tooling. Now it's seamlessly integrated in Android Studio and is actively used by many companies 
for developing Android applications.
* **Kotlin support in Android Jetpack and other libraries**. [KTX extensions](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) add Kotlin language features, 
such as coroutines, extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters, to existing Android libraries.
* **Interoperability with Java**. You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming language in your applications without needing to migrate all your code 
to Kotlin.
* **Support for multiplatform development**. You can use Kotlin for developing not only Android but also [iOS](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/), backend, and web applications. 
Enjoy the benefits of sharing the common code among the platforms.
* **Code safety**. Less code and better readability lead to fewer errors. The Kotlin compiler detects these remaining errors, making the code safe.
* **Easy learning**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
* **Big community**. Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, which is growing all over the world. 
According to Google, over 60% of the top 1000 apps on the Play Store use Kotlin.

Many startups and Fortune 500 companies have already developed Android applications using Kotlin – see the list at [the Google website for Kotlin developers](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
