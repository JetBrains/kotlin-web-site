[//]: # (title: Swift package export setup)

You can set up the Kotlin/Native output for an Apple target to be consumed as a Swift package manager (SPM) dependency.

Consider a Kotlin Multiplatform project that has an iOS target. You may want to make this iOS binary available
as a dependency to iOS developers working on native Swift projects. Using Kotlin Multiplatform tooling, you can provide
an artifact that would seamlessly integrate with their Xcode projects.

This tutorial shows how to do this by building [XCFrameworks](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md#build-xcframeworks)
with the Kotlin Gradle plugin.

## Set up remote integration

To make your framework consumable, you'll need to upload two files:

* A ZIP archive with the XCFramework. You'll need to upload it to a convenient file storage with direct access (for example,
  creating a GitHub release with the archive attached, using Amazon S3 or Maven).
  Choose the option that is easiest to integrate into your workflow.
* The `Package.swift` file describing the package. You'll need to push it to a separate Git repository.

#### Project configuration options {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

In this tutorial, you'll store your XCFramework as a binary in your preferred file storage, and the `Package.swift` file
in a separate Git repository.

However, you can configure your project differently. Consider the following options for organizing Git repositories:

* Store the `Package.swift` file and the code that should be packaged into an XCFramework in separate Git repositories.
  This allows versioning the Swift manifest separately from the project the file describes. This is the recommended approach:
  it allows scaling and is generally easier to maintain.
* Put the `Package.swift` file next to your Kotlin Multiplatform code. This is a more straightforward approach, but
  keep in mind that, in this case, the Swift package and the code will use the same versioning. SPM uses
  Git tags for versioning packages, which can conflict with tags used for your project.
* Store the `Package.swift` file within the consumer project's repository. This helps to avoid versioning and maintenance issues.
  However, this approach can cause problems with multi-repository SPM setups of the consumer project and further automation:

  * In a multi-package project, only one consumer package can depend on the external module (to avoid dependency conflicts
    within the project). So, all the logic that depends on your Kotlin Multiplatform module should be encapsulated in a
    particular consumer package.
  * If you publish the Kotlin Multiplatform project using an automated CI process, this process would need to include
    publishing the updated `Package.swift` file to the consumer repository. This may lead to conflicting updates of the
    consumer repository and so such a phase in CI can be difficult to maintain.

### Configure your multiplatform project

In the following example, the shared code of a Kotlin Multiplatform project is stored locally in the `shared` module.
If your project is structured differently, substitute "shared" in code and path examples with your module's name.

To set up the publishing of an XCFramework:

1. Update your `shared/build.gradle.kts` configuration file with the `XCFramework` call in the iOS targets list:

   ```kotlin
   import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.mpp.apple.XCFramework
   
   kotlin {
       // Other Kotlin Multiplatform targets
       // ...
       // Name of the module to be imported in the consumer project
       val xcframeworkName = "Shared"
       val xcf = XCFramework(xcframeworkName)
   
       listOf(
           iosX64(),
           iosArm64(),
           iosSimulatorArm64(),
       ).forEach { 
           it.binaries.framework {
               baseName = xcframeworkName
               
               // Specify CFBundleIdentifier to uniquely identify the framework
               binaryOption("bundleId", "org.example.${xcframeworkName}")
               xcf.add(this)
               isStatic = true
           }
       }
       //...
   }
   ```
   
2. Run the Gradle task to create the framework:
   
   `./gradlew :shared:assembleSharedReleaseXCFramework`
  
   The resulting framework will be created as the `shared/build/XCFrameworks/release/Shared.xcframework` folder in your project directory.

   > In case you work with a Compose Multiplatform project, use the following Gradle task:
   >
   > `./gradlew :composeApp:assembleSharedReleaseXCFramework`
   >
   > You can then find the resulting framework in the `composeApp/build/XCFrameworks/release/Shared.xcframework` folder.
   >

### Prepare the XCFramework and the Swift package manifest

1. Put the `Shared.xcframework` folder in a ZIP archive and calculate the checksum for the resulting archive, for example:
   
   `swift package compute-checksum Shared.xcframework.zip`

<anchor name="upload"/>

2. Upload the ZIP file to the file storage of your choice.
3. Choose any directory and locally create a `Package.swift` file with the following code:

   ```Swift
   // swift-tools-version:5.3
   import PackageDescription
    
   let package = Package(
      name: "Shared",
      platforms: [
        .iOS(.v14),
      ],
      products: [
         .library(name: "Shared", targets: ["Shared"])
      ],
      targets: [
         .binaryTarget(
            name: "Shared",
            url: "<link to the uploaded XCFramework ZIP file>",
            checksum:"<checksum calculated for the ZIP file>")
      ]
   )
   ```
   
4. In the `url` field, specify the link to your ZIP archive with the XCFramework.
5. [Optional] If you'd like to validate the resulting manifest, you can run the following shell command in the directory
   with the `Package.swift` file:

    ```shell
    swift package reset && swift package show-dependencies --format json
    ```
    
    The output will describe any errors found or show the successful download and parsing result if the manifest is correct.

6. Push the `Package.swift` file to your remote repository. Make sure to create and push a Git tag with the
   semantic version of the package.

### Add the package dependency

Now that both files are accessible, you can add the package dependency:

1. In Xcode, choose **File | Add Package Dependencies**.
2. In the search field, enter the URL of the Git repository with the `Package.swift` file inside:

   ![Specify repo with the package file](native-spm-url.png)

3. Depending on the type of your project, the dialog will vary:
   * If you're making a Swift package, press the **Copy package** button. This will put a `.package` line in your clipboard.
     Paste this line into the [Package.Dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/package/dependency)
     block of your own `Package.swift` file, and add the necessary product to the appropriate `Target.Dependency` block.
   * For other Xcode projects, press the **Add package** button, then select products and corresponding targets for the package.

### Check your setup

To check that everything is set up correctly, test the import in Xcode:

1. In your project, navigate to the `ContentView.swift` file.
2. Replace the code with the following snippet:
   
    ```Swift
    import SwiftUI
    import Shared
    
    struct ContentView: View {
        var body: some View {
            VStack {
                Image(systemName: "globe")
                    .imageScale(.large)
                    .foregroundStyle(.tint)
                Text("Hello, world! \(Shared.Platform_iosKt.getPlatform().name)")
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
    
    #Preview {
        ContentView()
    }
    ```
   
    Here, you import the `Shared` XCFramework and then use it to obtain the platform name in the `Text` field.

3. Ensure that the preview is updated with the new text.

## Exporting multiple modules as an XCFramework

To make code from several Kotlin Multiplatform modules available as an iOS binary, combine these modules in a single
umbrella module. Then, build and export the XCFramework of this umbrella module.

For example, you have a `network` and a `database` module, which you combine in an `together` module:

1. In the `together/build.gradle.kts` file, specify dependencies and the framework configuration:

    ```kotlin
    kotlin {
        val frameworkName = "together"
        val xcf = XCFramework(frameworkName)
    
        listOf(
            iosX64(),
            iosArm64(),
            iosSimulatorArm64()
        ).forEach { iosTarget ->
            // Same as in the example above,
            // with added export calls for dependencies
            iosTarget.binaries.framework {
                export(projects.network)
                export(projects.database)
    
                baseName = frameworkName
                xcf.add(this)
            }
        }
    
        // Dependencies set as "api" (as opposed to "implementation") to export underlying modules
        sourceSets {
            commonMain.dependencies {
                api(projects.network)
                api(projects.database)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Each of the included modules should have its iOS targets configured, for example:

    ```kotlin
    kotlin {
        androidTarget {
            //...
        }
        
        iosX64()
        iosArm64()
        iosSimulatorArm64()
        
        //...
    }
    ```

3. Create an empty Kotlin file inside the `together` folder, for example, `together/src/commonMain/kotlin/Together.kt`.
   This is a workaround, as the Gradle script currently cannot assemble a framework if the exported module does not
   contain any source code.

4. Run the Gradle task that assembles the framework:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew :together:assembleTogetherReleaseXCFramework
    ```

5. Follow steps 4â€“7 from [the previous section](#upload) for `together.xcframework`: archive, calculate the checksum,
   upload the archived XCFramework, create and push a `Package.swift` file.

Now, you can import the dependency into an Xcode project. After adding the `import together` directive,
you should have classes from both the `network` and `database` modules available for import in Swift code.
