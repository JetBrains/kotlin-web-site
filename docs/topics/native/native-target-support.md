[//]: # (title: Kotlin/Native target support)

The Kotlin/Native compiler supports a great number of different targets, though it is hard to provide the same level of
support for all of them. This document describes which targets Kotlin/Native supports and breaks them into several
tiers depending on how well the compiler supports them.

> We can adjust the number of tiers, the list of supported targets, and their features as we go.

{type="note"}

* **Gradle target name** is a [target preset](multiplatform-set-up-targets.md) that is used in the
    Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin to enable the target.
* **Target triple** is a target name according to the `<architecture>-<vendor>-<system>-<abi>` structure that is commonly
  used by [compilers](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple).
* **Features**, additional target features:
  * üß™ means out of the box support for running tests in Gradle and IDE.
  
    This is only available on a native host for the specific target. For example, you can run `macosX64` and `iosX64` tests
    only on macOS x86-64 host.
  * üçè means that the target is available only on a macOS host.

## Tier 1

* The target is regularly tested on CI to be able to compile and run.
* We're doing our best to provide source and [binary compatibility between compiler releases](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42293).

| Gradle target name  | Target triple                 | Features | Description                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| `linuxX64`          | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    | üß™    | x86-64 Linux                    |
| `macosX64`          | `x86_64-apple-macos`          | üß™ üçè | x86-64 macOS                    |
| `macosArm64`        | `aarch64-apple-macos`         | üß™ üçè | Apple silicon-based macOS       |
| `iosSimulatorArm64` | `aarch64-apple-ios-simulator` | üß™ üçè | iOS simulator for Apple silicon |
| `iosX64`            | `x86_64-apple-ios-simulator`  | üß™ üçè | iOS simulator for x86-64        |

## Tier 2

* The target is regularly tested on CI to be able to compile, but may not be automatically tested to be able to run.
* We're doing our best to provide source and [binary compatibility between compiler releases](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42293).

| Gradle target name      | Target triple                     | Features | Description                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `iosArm64`              | `aarch64-apple-ios`               | üçè       | 64-bit Apple iOS and iPadOS device  |
| `linuxArm64`            | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`       |          | AArch64 Linux                       |
| `watchosSimulatorArm64` | `aarch64-apple-watchos-simulator` | üß™ üçè    | watchOS simulator for Apple silicon |
| `watchosX64`            | `x86_64-apple-watchos-simulator`  | üß™ üçè    | watchOS simulator for x86-64        |
| `watchosArm32`          | `armv7k-apple-watchos`            | üçè       | 32-bit Apple Watch                  |
| `watchosArm64`          | `arm64_32-apple-watchos`          | üçè       | 64-bit Apple Watch with ILP32       |
| `tvosSimulatorArm64`    | `aarch64-apple-tvos-simulator`    | üß™ üçè    | tvOS simulator for Apple silicon    |
| `tvosX64`               | `x86_64-apple-tvos-simulator`     | üß™ üçè    | tvOS simulator for x86-64           |
| `tvosArm64`             | `aarch64-apple-tvos`              | üçè       | 64-bit Apple tvOS                   |

> We're doing our best to move `iosArm64` to Tier 1, as it's a crucial target for [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.md).
> To do that, we need first to create a dedicated testing infrastructure because platform limitations make it difficult
> to run compiler tests on Apple devices. Meanwhile, we rely on running tests regularly for similar targets, like
> `iosSimulatorArm64`, which should be sufficient in most cases.

## Tier 3

* The target is not guaranteed to be tested on CI.
* We can't promise source and binary compatibility between different compiler releases, though such changes for these
  targets are quite rare.

| Gradle target name   | Target triple                   | Features | Description            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| `androidNativeArm32` | `arm-unknown-linux-androideabi` |          | Android NDK ARM 32-bit |
| `androidNativeArm64` | `aarch64-unknown-linux-android` |          | Android NDK ARM 64-bit |
| `androidNativeX86`   | `i686-unknown-linux-android`    |          | Android NDK x86        |
| `androidNativeX64`   | `x86_64-unknown-linux-android`  |          | Android NDK x86-64     |
| `watchosDeviceArm64` | `aarch64-apple-watchos`         | üçè       | 64-bit Apple Watch     |
| `mingwX64`           | `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`         | üß™       | x86-64 MinGW           |

## Deprecated targets

The following targets are deprecated since Kotlin 1.8.20 and will be removed in 1.9.20:

* `iosArm32`
* `watchosX86`
* `wasm32`
* `mingwX86`
* `linuxArm32Hfp`
* `linuxMips32`
* `linuxMipsel32`

## Libraries

It is hard for the library authors to test more targets or provide stricter guarantees than the Kotlin/Native compiler.
We suggest the following approach when considering support of native targets:

* Support all targets
* Regularly test targets from Tier 1 and 2 that support testing out of the box (üß™).

The Kotlin team uses this approach in the official Kotlin libraries, like [kotlinx.coroutines](coroutines-guide.md) and [kotlinx.serialization](serialization.md).
