[//]: # (title: Integration with Swift/Objective-C ARC)

Kotlin and Objective-C use different memory management strategies. Kotlin has a tracing garbage collector,
while Objective-C relies on automatic reference counting (ARC).

The integration between these strategies is usually seamless and generally requires no additional work.
However, there are some specifics you should keep in mind:

## Threads

### Deinitializers

Deinitialization on the Swift/Objective-C objects and the objects they refer to is called on the main thread if
these objects are passed to Kotlin on the main thread, for example:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
class KotlinExample {
    fun action(arg: Any) {
        println(arg)
    }
}
```

```swift
// Swift
class SwiftExample {
    init() {
        print("init on \(Thread.current)")
    }

    deinit {
        print("deinit on \(Thread.current)")
    }
}

func test() {
    KotlinExample().action(arg: SwiftExample())
}
```

The resulting output:

```text
init on <_NSMainThread: 0x600003bc0000>{number = 1, name = main}
shared.SwiftExample
deinit on <_NSMainThread: 0x600003bc0000>{number = 1, name = main}
```

Deinitialization on the Swift/Objective-C objects is called on a special GC thread instead of the main one if:

* Swift/Objective-C objects are passed to Kotlin on a thread other than main.
* The main dispatch queue isn't processed.

If you want to call deinitialization on a special GC thread explicitly,
set `kotlin.native.binary.objcDisposeOnMain=false` in your `gradle.properties`. This option
enables deinitialization on a special GC thread, even if Swift/Objective-C objects were passed to Kotlin on the main thread.

A special GC thread complies with the Objective-C runtime, meaning that it has a run loop and
drain autorelease pools.

### Completion handlers

When calling Kotlin suspending functions from Swift, completion handlers might be called on threads other than the main
one, for example:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
// coroutineScope, launch, and delay are from kotlinx.coroutines
suspend fun asyncFunctionExample() = coroutineScope {
    launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello")
}
```

```swift
// Swift
func test() {
    print("Running test on \(Thread.current)")
    PlatformKt.asyncFunctionExample(completionHandler: { _ in
        print("Running completion handler on \(Thread.current)")
    })
}
```

The resulting output:

```text
Running test on <_NSMainThread: 0x600001b100c0>{number = 1, name = main}
Hello
World!
Running completion handler on <NSThread: 0x600001b45bc0>{number = 7, name = (null)}
```

## Garbage collection and lifecycle

### Object reclamation

An object is reclaimed only during the garbage collection. This applies to Swift/Objective-C objects that cross interop
boundaries into Kotlin/Native, for example:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
class KotlinExample {
    fun action(arg: Any) {
        println(arg)
    }
}
```

```swift
// Swift
class SwiftExample {
    deinit {
        print("SwiftExample deinit")
    }
}

func test() {
    swiftTest()
    kotlinTest()
}

func swiftTest() {
    print(SwiftExample())
    print("swiftTestFinished")
}

func kotlinTest() {
    KotlinExample().action(arg: SwiftExample())
    print("kotlinTest finished")
}
```

The resulting output:

```text
shared.SwiftExample
SwiftExample deinit
swiftTestFinished
shared.SwiftExample
kotlinTest finished
SwiftExample deinit
```

### Objective-C objects lifecycle

The Objective-C objects might live longer than they should, which sometimes might cause performance issues. For example,
when a long-running loop creates several temporary objects that cross the Swift/Objective-C interop boundary on each iteration.

In the [GC logs](native-memory-manager.md#monitor-gc-performance), there's a number of stable refs in the root set.
If this number keeps growing, it may indicate that the Swift/Objective-C objects are not freed up when they should.
In this case, try the `autoreleasepool` block around loop bodies that do interop calls:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
fun growingMemoryUsage() {
    repeat(Int.MAX_VALUE) {
        NSLog("$it\n")
    }
}

fun steadyMemoryUsage() {
    repeat(Int.MAX_VALUE) {
        autoreleasepool {
            NSLog("$it\n")
        }
    }
}
```

### Garbage collection of Swift and Kotlin objects' chains

Consider the following example:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
interface Storage {
    fun store(arg: Any)
}

class KotlinStorage(var field: Any? = null) : Storage {
    override fun store(arg: Any) {
        field = arg
    }
}

class KotlinExample {
    fun action(firstSwiftStorage: Storage, secondSwiftStorage: Storage) {
        // Here, we create the following chain:
        // firstKotlinStorage -> firstSwiftStorage -> secondKotlinStorage -> secondSwiftStorage.
        val firstKotlinStorage = KotlinStorage()
        firstKotlinStorage.store(firstSwiftStorage)
        val secondKotlinStorage = KotlinStorage()
        firstSwiftStorage.store(secondKotlinStorage)
        secondKotlinStorage.store(secondSwiftStorage)
    }
}
```

```swift
// Swift
class SwiftStorage : Storage {

    let name: String

    var field: Any? = nil

    init(_ name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func store(arg: Any) {
        field = arg
    }

    deinit {
        print("deinit SwiftStorage \(name)")
    }
}

func test() {
    KotlinExample().action(
        firstSwiftStorage: SwiftStorage("first"),
        secondSwiftStorage: SwiftStorage("second")
    )
}
```

It takes some time between "deinit SwiftStorage first" and "deinit SwiftStorage second" messages to appear in the
log. The reason is that `firstKotlinStorage` and `secondKotlinStorage` are collected in different GC cycles.
Here's the sequence of events:

1. `KotlinExample.action` finishes. `firstKotlinStorage` is considered "dead" because nothing references it,
    while `secondKotlinStorage` is not because it is referenced by `firstSwiftStorage`.
2. First GC cycle starts, and `firstKotlinStorage` is collected.
3. There are no references to `firstSwiftStorage`, so it is "dead" as well, and `deinit` is called.
4. Second GC cycle starts. `secondKotlinStorage` is collected because `firstSwiftStorage` is no longer referencing it.
5. `secondSwiftStorage` is finally reclaimed.

It requires two GC cycles to collect these four objects because deinitialization of Swift and Objective-C objects happens
after the GC cycle. The limitation stems from `deinit`, which can call arbitrary code, including the Kotlin code that
cannot be run during the GC pause.

### Retain cycles

In a _retain cycle_, a number of objects refer each other using strong references cyclically:

![Retain cycles](native-retain-cycle.png){height=200}

Kotlin's tracing GC and Objective-C's ARC handle retain cycles differently. When objects become unreachable, Kotlin's GC
can properly reclaim such cycles, while Objective-C's ARC cannot. Therefore, retain cycles of Kotlin objects can be reclaimed,
while [retain cycles of Swift/Objective-C objects cannot](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/automaticreferencecounting/#Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances).

Consider the case when a retain cycle contains both Objective-C and Kotlin objects:

![Retain cycles with Objective-C and Kotlin objects](native-objc-kotlin-retain-cycles.png){height=150}

This involves combining Kotlin's and Objective-C's memory management models that cannot handle (reclaim) retain cycles
together. That means if at least one Objective-C object is present, the retain cycle of a whole graph of objects
cannot be reclaimed, and it's impossible to break the cycle from the Kotlin side.

Unfortunately, no special instruments are currently available to automatically detect retain cycles in Kotlin/Native code.
To avoid retain cycles, use [weak or unowned references](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/automaticreferencecounting/#Resolving-Strong-Reference-Cycles-Between-Class-Instances).

## Support for background state and App Extensions

The current memory manager does not track application state by default and does not integrate
with [App Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/app-extensions/) out of the box.

It means that the memory manager doesn't adjust GC behavior accordingly, which might be harmful in some cases. To change
this behavior, add the following [Experimental](components-stability.md) binary option to your `gradle.properties`:

```none
kotlin.native.binary.appStateTracking=enabled
```

It turns off a timer-based invocation of the garbage collector when the application is in the background, so GC is called
only when memory consumption becomes too high.
