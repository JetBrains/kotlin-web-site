[//]: # (title: Definition file)

Kotlin/Native enables you to consume C and Objective-C libraries, allowing you to use their functionality in Kotlin.
A special tool called cinterop takes a C or an Objective-C library and generates the corresponding Kotlin bindings,
so that the library's methods can be used in your Kotlin code as usual.

To generate these bindings, each library needs a definition file, usually with the same name as the library.
This is a property file that describes exactly how the library should be consumed. See the full [list of available properties](#properties).

Here's a general workflow when working with a project:

1. Create a `.def` file describing what to include in the bindings.
2. Use the generated bindings in your Kotlin code.
3. Run the Kotlin/Native compiler to produce the final executable.

## Create and configure a definition file

Let's create a definition file and generate bindings for a C library:

1. In your IDE, select the `src` folder and create a new directory with **File | New | Directory**.
2. Name the new directory `nativeInterop/cinterop`.
   
   This is the default convention for `.def` file locations, but it can
   be overridden in the `build.gradle.kts` file if you use a different location.
3. Select the new subfolder and create a `png.def` file with **File | New | File**.
4. Add the necessary properties:

   ```none
   headers = png.h
   headerFilter = png.h
   package = png
   
   compilerOpts.linux = -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
   linkerOpts.osx = -L/opt/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/png/lib -lpng
   linkerOpts.linux = -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lpng
   ```

   * `headers` is the list of header files to generate Kotlin stubs for. You can add multiple files to this entry,
     separating each with a space. In this case, it's only `png.h`. The referenced files need to be available
     on the specified path (in this case, it's `/usr/include/png`).
   * `headerFilter` shows what exactly is included. In C, all the headers are also included when one file references
     another one with the `#include` directive. Sometimes it's not necessary, and you can add this parameter
     [using glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to make adjustments.

     You can use `headerFilter` if you don't want to fetch external dependencies (such as system `stdint.h` header) into
     the interop library. Also, it may be useful for library size optimization and fixing potential conflicts between
     the system and the provided Kotlin/Native compilation environment.

   * If the behavior for a certain platform needs to be modified, you can use a format like `compilerOpts.osx` or
     `compilerOpts.linux` to provide platform-specific values to the options. In this case, they are macOS
     (the `.osx` suffix) and Linux (the `.linux` suffix). Parameters without a suffix are also possible
     (for example, `linkerOpts=`) and applied to all platforms.

5. To generate bindings, synchronize the Gradle files by clicking **Sync Now** in the notification.

   ![Synchronize the Gradle files](gradle-sync.png)

After the bindings generation, the IDE can use them as a proxy view of the native library.

> You can also configure bindings generation by using the [cinterop tool](#generate-bindings-using-command-line) in the command line.

In addition to the list of properties, you can include [custom declarations](#add-custom-declarations) in your definition
file.

### Import headers

If a C library does not have a Clang module and instead consists of a set of headers, use the `headers` property to
specify headers that should be imported:

```none
headers = curl/curl.h
```

#### Filter headers by globs

You can filter headers by globs using filter properties from the `.def` file. To include declarations from headers,
use the `headerFilter` property. If a header matches any of the globs, its declarations are included in the bindings.

The globs are applied to the header paths relative to the appropriate include path elements,
for example, `time.h` or `curl/curl.h`. So if the library is usually included with `#include <SomeLibrary/Header.h>`,
you can probably filter headers with the following filter:

```none
headerFilter = SomeLibrary/**
```

If `headerFilter` is not provided, all the headers are included. However, we encourage you to use `headerFilter`
and specify the glob as precisely as possible. In this case, the generated library contains only the necessary
declarations. It can help avoid various issues when upgrading Kotlin or tools in your development environment.

#### Exclude headers

To exclude specific headers, use the `excludeFilter` property. It can be helpful to remove redundant or problematic
headers and optimize compilation, as declarations from the specified headers are not included in the bindings:

```none
excludeFilter = SomeLibrary/time.h
```

> If the same header is both included with `headerFilter`, and excluded with `excludeFilter`, the specified header will
> not be included in the bindings.
>
{style="note"}

### Import modules

If an Objective-C library has a Clang module, use the `modules` property to specify the module to be imported:

```none
modules = UIKit
```

### Pass compiler and linker options

Use the `compilerOpts` property to pass options to the C compiler, which is used to analyze headers under the hood.
To pass options to the linker, which is used to link final executables, use `linkerOpts`. For example:

```none
compilerOpts = -DFOO=bar
linkerOpts = -lpng
```

You can also specify target-specific options that apply only to a certain target:

```none
compilerOpts = -DBAR=bar
compilerOpts.linux_x64 = -DFOO=foo1
compilerOpts.macos_x64 = -DFOO=foo2
```

With this configuration, headers are analyzed using `-DBAR=bar -DFOO=foo1` on Linux and `-DBAR=bar -DFOO=foo2`
on macOS. Note that any definition file option can have both common and platform-specific parts.

### Ignore specific functions

Use the `excludedFunctions` property to specify a list of the function names that should be ignored. This can be
useful if a function declared in the header isn't guaranteed to be callable, and
it's difficult or impossible to determine this automatically. You can also use this property to work around a bug
in the interop itself.

### Include a static library

> This feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). It may be dropped or changed at any time.
> Use it only for evaluation purposes.
>
{style="warning"}

Sometimes it's more convenient to ship a static library with your product, rather than assume it is available within
the user's environment. To include a static library into `.klib`, use `staticLibrary` and `libraryPaths` properties:

```none
headers = foo.h
staticLibraries = libfoo.a
libraryPaths = /opt/local/lib /usr/local/opt/curl/lib
```

When given the above snippet, the cinterop tool searches `libfoo.a` in `/opt/local/lib` and `/usr/local/opt/curl/lib`,
and if found, includes the library binary in the `klib`.

When using a `klib` like this in your program, the library is linked automatically.

### Configure enums generation

Use the `strictEnums` property to generate enums as Kotlin enums or `nonStrictEnums` to generate them as integral
values. If an enum is not included in either of these lists, it is generated based on heuristics.

### Set up string conversion

Use the `noStringConversion` property to disable automatic conversion of the `const char*` function parameters as
Kotlin `String`s.

### Allow calling a non-designated initializer

By default, the Kotlin/Native compiler doesn't allow calling a non-designated Objective-C initializer as a `super()`
constructor. This behavior can be inconvenient if the designated Objective-C initializers aren't marked properly in the
library. To disable these compiler checks, use the `disableDesignatedInitializerChecks` property.

### Handle Objective-C exceptions

By default, the program crashes if Objective-C exceptions reach the Objective-C to Kotlin interop boundary and get to the
Kotlin code.

To propagate Objective-C exceptions to Kotlin, enable wrapping with the `foreignExceptionMode = objc-wrap` property.
In this case, Objective-C exceptions are translated into Kotlin exceptions that get the `ForeignException` type.

#### Help resolve linker errors

Linker errors might occur when a Kotlin library depends on C or Objective-C libraries, for example, using the
[CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md). If dependent libraries aren't installed locally on the machine or configured
explicitly in the project build script, the "Framework not found" error occurs.

If you're a library author, you can help your users resolve linker errors with custom messages.
To do that, add a `userSetupHint=message` property to your `.def` file or pass the `-Xuser-setup-hint` compiler option
to `cinterop`.

### Add custom declarations

Sometimes it is required to add custom C declarations to the library before generating bindings (for example, for [macros](native-c-interop.md#macros)).
Instead of creating an additional header file with these declarations, you can include them directly
to the end of the `.def` file, after a separating line, containing only the separator sequence `---`:

```none
headers = errno.h
---

static inline int getErrno() {
    return errno;
}
```

Note that this part of the `.def` file is treated as part of the header file, so functions with the body should be
declared as `static`. The declarations are parsed after including the files from the `headers` list.

## Generate bindings using command line

In addition to the definition file, you can specify what to include in bindings by passing the corresponding properties
as options in the `cinterop` call.

Here's an example of the command that produces a `png.klib` compiled library:

```bash
cinterop -def png.def -compiler-option -I/usr/local/include -o png
```

Note that the generated bindings are generally platform-specific, so if you are developing for multiple targets,
the bindings need to be regenerated.

* For host libraries that are not included in the sysroot search paths, headers may be needed.
* For a typical UNIX library with a configuration script, the `compilerOpts` will likely contain the output of a
  configuration script with the `--cflags` option (maybe without exact paths).
* The output of a configuration script with `--libs` can be passed to the `linkerOpts` property.
