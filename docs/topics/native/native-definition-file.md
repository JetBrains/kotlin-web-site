[//]: # (title: Definition file)

Kotlin/Native helps consume standard C and Objective-C libraries, allowing you to use their functionality in Kotlin.
A special cinterop tool takes a C or an Objective-C library and generates the corresponding Kotlin bindings,
so that the library methods can be used in your Kotlin code as usual.

To generate these bindings, each library should have its definition file, usually with the same name as the library.
This is a property file that describes how exactly the library should be consumed. See the full [list of available properties](#properties).

Here's a general workflow when working with a project:

1. Create a `.def` file describing what to include into bindings.
2. Use generated bindings in your Kotlin code.
3. Run the Kotlin/Native compiler to produce the final executable.

## Create and configure a definition file

Let's create a definition file and generate bindings for a C library:

1. In your IDE, select the `src` folder and create a new directory with **File | New | Directory**.
2. Name new directory **nativeInterop/cinterop**.
   
   This is the default convention for header file locations, though it can
   be overridden in the `build.gradle.kts` file if you use a different location.
3. Select this new subfolder and create a `png.def` file with **File | New | File**.
4. Add the necessary properties:

   ```none
   headers = png.h
   headerFilter = png.h
   package = png
   
   compilerOpts.linux = -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
   linkerOpts.osx = -L/opt/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/png/lib -lpng
   linkerOpts.linux = -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lpng
   ```

   * `headers` is the list of header files to generate Kotlin stubs. You can add multiple files to this entry,
     separating each with a `\` on a new line. In this case, it's only `png.h`. The referenced files need to be available
     on the system path (in this case, it's `/usr/include/png`).
   * `headerFilter` shows what exactly is included. In C, all the headers are also included when one file references
     another one with the `#include` directive. Sometimes it's not necessary, and you can add this parameter
     [using glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to fine-tune things.

     `headerFilter` is an optional argument and is mostly used when the library is installed as a system library. You don't
     want to fetch external dependencies (such as system `stdint.h` header) into the interop library. It may be important to
     optimize the library size and fix potential conflicts between the system and the provided Kotlin/Native compilation
     environment.

   * If the behavior for a certain platform needs to be modified, you can use a format like `compilerOpts.osx` or
     `compilerOpts.linux` to provide platform-specific values to the options. In this case, they are macOS
     (the `.osx` suffix) and Linux (the `.linux` suffix). Parameters without a suffix are also possible
     (for example, `linkerOpts=`) and applied to all platforms.

5. To generate bindings, synchronize the Gradle files by clicking **Sync Now** in the notification.

   ![Synchronize the Gradle files](gradle-sync.png)

After the bindings generation, the IDE can use them as a proxy view of the native library.

In addition to the list of properties, you can include [custom declarations](#add-custom-declarations) in your definition
file.

### Import headers

If a C library does not have a Clang module and instead consists of a set of headers, use the `headers` property to
specify headers that should be imported:

```none
headers = curl/curl.h
```

#### Filter headers by globs

You can filter headers by globs using filter properties from the `.def` file. To include declarations from headers,
use the `headerFilter` property. If a header matches any of the globs, its declarations are included in the bindings.

The globs are applied to the header paths relative to the appropriate include path elements,
for example, `time.h` or `curl/curl.h`. So if the library is usually included with `#include <SomeLibrary/Header.h>`,
it would probably be correct to filter headers with the following filter:

```none
headerFilter = SomeLibrary/**
```

If `headerFilter` is not provided, all the headers are included. However, we encourage you to use `headerFilter`
and specify the glob as precisely as possible. In this case, the generated library contains only the necessary
declarations. It can help avoid various issues when upgrading Kotlin or tools in your development environment.

#### Exclude headers

To exclude specific headers, use the `excludeFilter` property. It can be helpful to remove redundant or problematic
headers and optimize compilation, as declarations from the specified headers are not included into the bindings:

```none
excludeFilter = SomeLibrary/time.h
```

> If the same header is both included with `headerFilter`, and excluded with `excludeFilter`, the specified header will
> not be included into the bindings.
>
{type="note"}

### Import modules

If a C library has a Clang module, use the `modules` property to specify the module that should be imported:

```none
modules = UIKit
```

### Pass compiler and linker options

Use the `compilerOpts` property to pass options to the C compiler, which is used to analyze headers under the hood.
To pass options to the linker, which is used to link final executables, use `linkerOpts`. For example:

```none
compilerOpts = -DFOO=bar
linkerOpts = -lpng
```

Target-specific options only applicable to the certain target can be specified as well:

```none
compilerOpts = -DBAR=bar
compilerOpts.linux_x64 = -DFOO=foo1
compilerOpts.macos_x64 = -DFOO=foo2
```

With such a configuration, headers will be analyzed with `-DBAR=bar -DFOO=foo1` on Linux and with `-DBAR=bar -DFOO=foo2`
on macOS. Note that any definition file option can have both common and platform-specific parts.

### Ignore specific functions

Use the `excludedFunctions` property to specify a list of the function names that should be ignored. This may be
helpful in case a function declared in the header is not generally guaranteed to be really callable, and
it's often hard or impossible to figure this out automatically. You can also use this property to work around a bug
in the interop itself.

### Include a static library

> Use it only for evaluation purposes.
>
{type="warning"}

Sometimes it's more convenient to ship a static library with your product, rather than assume it is available within
the user's environment. To include a static library into `.klib`, use `staticLibrary` and `libraryPaths` properties:

```none
headers = foo.h
staticLibraries = libfoo.a
libraryPaths = /opt/local/lib /usr/local/opt/curl/lib
```

When given the above snippet the `cinterop` tool will search `libfoo.a` in `/opt/local/lib` and `/usr/local/opt/curl/lib`,
and if it is found include the library binary into `klib`.

When using such `klib` in your program, the library is linked automatically.

### Configure enums generation

Use the `strictEnums` property to generate enums as Kotlin enums or `nonStrictEnums` to generate them as integral
values . If the enum is not included into any of these lists, then it is generated according to the heuristics.

### Set up string conversion

Use the `noStringConversion` property to disable automatic conversion of the `const char*` function parameters as
Kotlin `String`s.

### Allow calling a non-designated initializer

By default, the Kotlin/Native compiler doesn't allow calling a non-designated initializer as a `super()`
constructor. This behaviour can be inconvenient if the designated initializers aren't marked properly in the
library. To disable these compiler checks, use the `disableDesignatedInitializerChecks` property.

### Handle Objective-C exceptions

By default, the program crashes if Objective-C exceptions reach the Objective-C to Kotlin interop boundry and get to the
Kotlin code.

To make Kotlin properly handle Objective-C exceptions, enable wrapping with the `foreignExceptionMode = objc-wrap`property.
In this case, Objective-C exceptions are translated into Kotlin exceptions that get the `ForeignException` type.

#### Help resolve linker errors

Linker errors might occur when a Kotlin library depends on C or Objective-C libraries, for example, using the
[CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md). If dependent libraries aren't installed locally on the machine or configured
explicitly in the project build script, the "Framework not found" error occurs.

If you're a library author, you can help your users resolve linker errors with custom messages.
To do that, add a `userSetupHint=message` property to your `.def` file or pass the `-Xuser-setup-hint` compiler option
to `cinterop`.

### Add custom declarations

Sometimes it is required to add custom C declarations to the library before generating bindings (for example, for [macros](native-c-interop.md#macros)).
Instead of creating an additional header file with these declarations, you can include them directly
to the end of the `.def` file, after a separating line, containing only the separator sequence `---`:

```none
headers = errno.h
---

static inline int getErrno() {
   return errno;
}
```

Note that this part of the `.def` file is treated as part of the header file, so functions with the body should be
declared as `static`. The declarations are parsed after including the files from the `headers` list.

## Generate bindings manually

You can invoke bindings generation manually, without project build files by using the `cinterop` tool. In this case,
you don't specify properties in the definition file, but pass them as options to the `cinterop` call, for example:

```bash
cinterop -def png.def -compiler-option -I/usr/local/include -o png
```

This command will produce a `png.klib` compiled library and the `png-build/kotlin` directory containing Kotlin source
code for the library.

Note that the generated bindings are generally platform-specific, so if you are developing for multiple targets,
the bindings need to be regenerated.

* For host libraries that are not included in the sysroot search paths, headers may be needed.
* For a typical Unix library with a configuration script, the `compilerOpts` will likely contain the output of a
  configuration script with the `--cflags` option (maybe without exact paths).
* The output of a configuration script with `--libs` will be passed as a `-linkedArgs` `kotlinc` option value (quoted)
  when compiling.
