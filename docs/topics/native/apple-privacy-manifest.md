[//]: # (title: Privacy manifest for iOS apps)

If your app is intended for the Apple App Store and uses [required reasons APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api),
App Store Connect may issue a warning that the app doesn't have the correct privacy manifest:

![Required reasons warning](app-store-required-reasons-warning.png){width="700"}

It can affect any Apple ecosystem app, native or multiplatform. Your app may be using a required reason API through a
third-party library or SDK, which may not be obvious. Kotlin Multiplatform could be one of the frameworks that uses APIs
you're unaware of.

On this page, you'll find a detailed description of the problem and a recommendation for dealing with it.

> This page reflects the Kotlin team's current understanding of the issue.
> As we have more data and knowledge about the accepted approach and workarounds, we'll update the page to reflect them.

## What's the issue

Apple requirements for App Store submissions are [changing in the spring of 2024](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=r1henawx).
You can already encounter warnings if you submit an app that doesn't specify a reason for using a required reason API in
its privacy manifest. Starting May 1, 2024, [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) will not accept such apps at all.

This is an automatic check, not a manual moderation: your app's code is analyzed, and you receive a list of issues in an
email. The email will reference the "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration" issue, listing all API categories used in the
app that fall under the [required reasons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api)
category.

Ideally, all SDKs that your app uses provide their own privacy manifest, and you don't need to worry about that.
But if some of your dependencies don't do this, your App Store submission may be flagged.

## How to resolve

After you have tried to submit your app and received a detailed issue list from the App Store, you can build your manifest
following the Apple documentation:

* [Privacy manifest files overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files)
* [Describing data use in privacy manifests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests)
* [Describing use of required reason API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api)

The resulting file is a collection of dictionaries. For each accessed API type, select one or more reasons for using it
from the provided list. Xcode helps edit `.xcprivacy` files by providing a visual layout and dropdown lists with
valid values for each field.

You can use a [special tool](#find-usages-of-required-reason-apis) to find usages of required reason APIs in the dependencies
of your Kotlin framework and a [separate plugin](#place-the-xcprivacy-file-in-your-kotlin-artifacts) to bundle
`.xcprivacy` file with your Kotlin artifacts.

If a new privacy manifest doesn't help satisfy App Store requirements or you cannot figure out how to go through the steps,
contact us and share your case in [this YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-67603).

## Find usages of required reason APIs

Kotlin code in your app or one of the dependencies may access required reason APIs from libraries such as `platform.posix`,
for example, `fstat`:

```kotlin
import platform.posix.fstat

fun useRequiredReasonAPI() {
    fstat(...)
}
```

In some cases, it may be difficult to determine which dependencies use the required reason API.
To help you find them, we've built a simple tool.

To use it, run the following command in the directory where the Kotlin framework is declared in your project:

```shell
/usr/bin/python3 -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/raw/rrf_v0.0.1/libraries/tools/required-reason-finder/required_reason_finder.py)"
```

You may also [download this script](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/rrf_v0.0.1/libraries/tools/required-reason-finder/required_reason_finder.py)
separately, inspect it, and run it using `python3`.

## Place the `.xcprivacy` file in your Kotlin artifacts

If you need to bundle the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file with your Kotlin artifacts, use the `apple-privacy-manifests` plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform")
    kotlin("apple-privacy-manifests") version "1.0.0"
}

kotlin {
    privacyManifest {
        embed(
            privacyManifest = layout.projectDirectory.file("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy").asFile,
        )
    }
}
```

The plugin will copy the privacy manifest file to the [corresponding output location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/adding_a_privacy_manifest_to_your_app_or_third-party_sdk?language=objc).

## Known usages

### Compose Multiplatform

Using Compose Multiplatform may result in `fstat`, `stat` and `mach_absolute_time` usages in your binary.
Even though these functions are not used for tracking or fingerprinting and are not sent from the device, Apple can still
flag them as APIs with missing required reasons. 

If you must specify a reason for `stat` and `fstat` usages, use `0A2A.1`. For `mach_absolute_time`, use `35F9.1`.

For further updates on required reasons APIs used in Compose Multiplatform, follow [this issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/4738).

### Kotlin/Native runtime in versions 1.9.10 or earlier

The `mach_absolute_time` API is used in the `mimalloc` allocator in the Kotlin/Native runtime. This was the default
allocator in Kotlin 1.9.10 and earlier versions.

We recommend upgrading to Kotlin 1.9.20 or later versions. If the upgrade is impossible, change the memory allocator.
To do that, set the `-Xallocator=custom` compilation option in your Gradle build script for the current Kotlin allocator
or `-Xallocator=std` for the system allocator.

For more information, see [Kotlin/Native memory management](native-memory-manager.md).
