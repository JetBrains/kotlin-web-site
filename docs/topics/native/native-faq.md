## How do I run my program?

Define a top-level function `fun main(args: Array<String>)` or just  `fun main()` if you are not interested
in passed arguments, please ensure it's not in a package.
Also, compiler switch `-entry` could be used to make any function taking `Array<String>` or no arguments
and return `Unit` as an entry point.

## What is Kotlin/Native memory management model?

Kotlin/Native uses an automated memory management scheme that is similar to what Java or Swift provide.

## How do I create a shared library?

Use the `-produce dynamic` compiler switch, or `binaries.sharedLib()` in Gradle.

```kotlin
kotlin {
    iosArm64("mylib") {
        binaries.sharedLib()
    }
}
```

It will produce a platform-specific shared object (`.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS, and `.dll` on Windows targets) and a
C language header, allowing the use of all public APIs available in your Kotlin/Native program from C/C++ code.

## How do I create a static library or an object file?

Use the `-produce static` compiler switch, or `binaries.staticLib()` in Gradle.

```kotlin
kotlin {
    iosArm64("mylib") {
        binaries.staticLib()
    }
}
```

It will produce a platform-specific static object (`.a` library format) and a C language header, allowing you to
use all the public APIs available in your Kotlin/Native program from C/C++ code.

## How do I run Kotlin/Native behind a corporate proxy?

As Kotlin/Native needs to download a platform specific toolchain, you need to specify
`-Dhttp.proxyHost=xxx -Dhttp.proxyPort=xxx` as the compiler's or `gradlew` arguments,
or set it via the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.

## How do I specify a custom Objective-C prefix/name for my Kotlin framework?

Use the `-module-name` compiler option or matching Gradle DSL statement.

    }
}
```

## How do I rename the iOS framework?

The default name is for an iOS framework  is `<project name>.framework`.
To set a custom name, use the `baseName` option. This will also set the module name.

```kotlin
kotlin {
    iosArm64("myapp") {
       binaries {
          framework {
              baseName = "TheName"
          }
       }
    }
}
```

## How do I enable bitcode for my Kotlin framework?

Bitcode embedding was deprecated in Xcode 14 and removed in Xcode 15 for all Apple targets.
The Kotlin/Native compiler does not support bitcode embedding since Kotlin 2.0.20.

If you're using earlier versions of Xcode but want to upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.20 or later versions, disable bitcode
embedding in your Xcode projects.

## Why do I see `InvalidMutabilityException`?

It likely happens, because you are trying to mutate a frozen object. An object can transfer to the
frozen state either explicitly, as objects reachable from objects on which the `kotlin.native.concurrent.freeze` is called,
or implicitly (i.e. reachable from `enum` or global singleton object - see the next question).

## How do I make a singleton object mutable?

Currently, singleton objects are immutable (i.e. frozen after creation), and it's generally considered
good practise to have the global state immutable. If for some reason you need a mutable state inside such an
object, use the `@konan.ThreadLocal` annotation on the object. Also, the `kotlin.native.concurrent.AtomicReference` class could be
used to store different pointers to frozen objects in a frozen object and automatically update them.

## How can I compile my project with unreleased versions of Kotlin/Native?

First, please consider trying [preview versions](eap.md).

In case you need an even more recent development version, you can build Kotlin/Native from source code:
clone [Kotlin repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) and follow [these steps](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/kotlin-native/README.md#building-from-source).
