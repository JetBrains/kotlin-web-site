Here you will learn how to create and run your first Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile application using Android Studio.

## Create the project from a template

{type="tip"}

1. In Android Studio, select **File | New | New Project**.
2. Select **Kotlin Multiplatform App** in the list of project templates, and click **Next**.

3. Specify a name for your first application, and click **Next**.

4. In the **iOS framework distribution** list, select the **Regular framework** option.

   ![Mobile Multiplatform project - additional settings](multiplatform-mobile-project-wizard-3.png){width=700}

   > We recommend using the regular framework for your first project, as this option doesn't require third-party tools and
   > has fewer installation issues.
   > 
   > For more complex projects, you might need the CocoaPods dependency manager that helps handle library dependencies.
   > To learn more about CocoaPods and how to set up an environment for them, see [CocoaPods overview and setup](native-cocoapods.md).
   >

5. Keep the default names for the application and shared folders. Click **Finish**.

The project will be set up automatically. It may take some time to download and set up the required components when you
do this for the first time.

## Examine the project structure

To view the full structure of your mobile multiplatform project, switch the view from **Android** to **Project**.

![Select the Project view](select-project-view.png){width=200}  

Each Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile project includes three modules:

* _shared_ is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications â€“ the code you share
  between platforms. It uses [Gradle](gradle.md) as the build system that helps you automate your build process. The _shared_
  module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.
* _androidApp_ is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
  The _androidApp_ module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.
* _iosApp_ is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as an iOS
  framework. The shared module can be used as a regular framework or as a [CocoaPods dependency](native-cocoapods.md),
  based on what you've chosen in the previous step in **iOS framework distribution**. In this tutorial, it's a regular
  framework dependency.

![Basic Multiplatform Mobile project structure](basic-project-structure.png){width=500}

The shared module consists of three source sets: `androidMain`, `commonMain`, and `iosMain`. _Source set_ is a Gradle
concept for a number of files logically grouped together where each group has its own dependencies. In Kotlin Multiplatform,
different source sets in a shared module can target different platforms.

> or Android Studio. Real-life projects can have more complex structures.

## Run your application

You can run your multiplatform application on [Android](#run-your-application-on-android) or [iOS](#run-your-application-on-ios).

### Run your application on Android

1. Create an [Android virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).
2. In the list of run configurations, select **androidApp**.
3. Choose your Android virtual device and click **Run**.

    ![First mobile multiplatform app on Android](first-multiplatform-project-on-android-1.png){width=300}

#### Run on a different Android simulated device {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Learn how to [configure the Android Emulator and run your application on a different simulated device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningapp).
    
#### Run on a real Android device {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Learn how to [configure and connect a hardware device and run your application on it](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

### Run your application on iOS

1. Launch Xcode in a separate window. The first time you may also need to accept its license terms and allow it to perform
   some necessary initial tasks.
2. In Android Studio, select **iosApp** in the list of run configurations and click **Run**.
   
   If you don't have an available iOS configuration in the list, add a [new iOS simulated device](#run-on-a-new-ios-simulated-device).
    
    ![Run multiplatform app on iOS](run-ios.png){width=450}
    
    ![First mobile multiplatform app on Android](first-multiplatform-project-on-ios-1.png){width=300}

#### Run on a new iOS simulated device {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

If you want to run your application on a simulated device, you can add a new run configuration.

1. In the list of run configurations, click **Edit Configurations**.

    ![Edit run configurations](ios-edit-configurations.png){width=450}

2. Click the **+** button above the list of configurations and select **iOS Application**.

    ![New run configuration for iOS application](ios-new-configuration.png)

3. Name your configuration.
4. Select the **Xcode project file**. For that, navigate to your project, for example **KotlinMultiplatformSandbox**,
   open the`iosApp` folder and select the `.xcodeproj` file.

5. In the **Execution target** list, select a simulated device and click **OK**.

    ![New run configuration with iOS simulator](ios-new-simulator.png)
    
6. Click **Run** to run your application on the new simulated device.
    
#### Run on a real iOS device {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

1. Connect a real iPhone device to Xcode.
2. Make sure to code sign your app. For more information, see the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device/).
3. [Create a run configuration](#run-on-a-new-ios-simulated-device) by selecting an iPhone in the **Execution target** list.
4. Click **Run** to run your application on the iPhone device.

## Update your application

1. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin`, open the `Greeting.kt` file in the project folder. This directory stores the shared
code for both Android and iOS. If you make changes to the shared code, you will see them reflected in both applications.

   ![Common Kotlin file](common-kotlin-file.png)

2. Update the shared code by using `[reversed()](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/reversed.html)`,
the Kotlin standard library function for reversing text that works on all platforms:

    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        private val platform: Platform = getPlatform()
        
        fun greet(): String {
            return "Guess what it is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Re-run the **androidApp** configuration to see the updated application in the Android simulated device.

    ![Updated mobile multiplatform app on Android](first-multiplatform-project-on-android-2.png){width=300}
    
4. In Android Studio, switch to **iosApp** and re-run it to see the updated application in the iOS simulated device.

## Next step

In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn about dependencies and add a third-party library to expand
the functionality of your project.
