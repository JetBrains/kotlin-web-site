### What is Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile?

_Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)_ is an SDK for cross-platform mobile development. You can develop 
multiplatform mobile applications and share parts of your applications between Android and iOS, such as core layers, 
business logic, presentation logic, and more.

Kotlin Mobile uses the [multiplatform abilities of Kotlin](multiplatform.md) and the features 
designed for mobile development, such as CocoaPods integration and the [Android Studio Plugin](#what-is-the-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-plugin).

You may want to watch this introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdN6P6RI__k), in which Kotlin Product Marketing Manager Ekaterina Petrova explains in detail what Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is and how you can use it in your projects. 
With Ekaterina, you'll set up an environment and prepare for creating your first cross-platform mobile application with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile.

### What is the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin?

The _[Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)_
for Android Studio helps you develop applications that work on both Android and iOS. 

With the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin, you can:
* Run, test, and debug the iOS part of your application on iOS targets straight from Android Studio.
* Quickly create a new multiplatform project.
* Add a multiplatform module into an existing project.

The Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin works only on macOS. This is because iOS simulators, per the Apple requirement, can run only on macOS 
but not on any other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows or Linux.

The good news is that you can work with cross-platform projects on Android even without the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin. If you are going to work 
with shared code or Android-specific code, you can work on any operating system supported by Android Studio.

### What is Kotlin/Native and how does it relate to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile?

_[Kotlin/Native](native-overview.md)_ is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native 
binaries, which can run without a virtual machine. It consists of an [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)-based backend for the 
Kotlin compiler and a native implementation of the Kotlin standard library.

Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or 
possible, such as embedded devices and iOS. It is particularly suitable for situations when the developer needs to produce 
a self-contained program that does not require an additional runtime or virtual machine. And that is exactly the case with 
iOS development.

Shared code, written in Kotlin, is compiled to JVM bytecode for Android with Kotlin/JVM and to native binaries for iOS 
with Kotlin/Native. It makes the integration with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile seamless on both platforms.

### What are the plans for the technology evolution?

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is one of the focus areas of the [Kotlin roadmap](roadmap.md). To see which parts we’re 
working on right now, check out the [roadmap details](roadmap.md#roadmap-details). 
Most of the recent changes affect the **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Kotlin/Native** sections.

The following video presents our plans on the upcoming stage of the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development – its promotion to [Beta](components-stability.md):

### Can I run an iOS application on Microsoft Windows or Linux?

If you want to write iOS-specific code and run an iOS application on a simulated or real device, use a Mac with a macOS
([use the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin for it](#what-is-the-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-plugin)). This is because iOS simulators can run only on macOS, per 
the Apple requirement, but cannot run on other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows or Linux.

If you are going to work with shared code or Android-specific code, you can work on any operating system supported by Android Studio.

### Where can I get complete examples to play with?

* [Curated samples](multiplatform-mobile-samples.md)
* Several [hands-on tutorials](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/overview)

### In which IDE should I work on my cross-platform app?

You can work in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Android Studio allows the use of the 
[Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](#what-is-the-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-plugin), which is a part of the Kotlin ecosystem. Enable the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin in Android Studio 
if you want to write iOS-specific code and launch an iOS application on a simulated or real device. The plugin can be used only on macOS.

Most of our adopters use Android Studio. However, if there is any reason for you not to use it, there is another option: 
you can use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). IntelliJ IDEA provides the ability to create 
a multiplatform mobile application from the Project Wizard, but you won’t be able to launch an iOS application from the IDE.

### How can I write concurrent code in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile projects?

You can learn how to work with [concurrency](multiplatform-mobile-concurrency-overview.md) on the documentation portal.

Working with concurrent code in cross-platform mobile projects might not seem straightforward, as different memory management approaches 
are used in Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native. The current approach for Kotlin/Native has some 
[limitations](native-concurrency.md). The new Kotlin/Native memory management model is on 
the [roadmap](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/07/kotlin-native-memory-management-roadmap) and the team is working 
on a solution for it.

### How can I speed up my Kotlin Multiplatform module compilation for iOS?
