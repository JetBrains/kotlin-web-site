Before you create your first application that works on both iOS and Android, you'll need to set up an environment for Kotlin Multiplatform
Mobile development.

> To write iOS-specific code and run an iOS application on a simulated or real device, you'll need a Mac with macOS.
> This cannot be performed on other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows. This is an Apple requirement.

## Install the necessary tools

We recommend that you install the latest stable versions for compatibility and better performance.

                We generally recommend using the latest stable versions for all tools. However, Kotlin/Native sometimes doesn't support the newest Xcode right away. If that's your case, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode">install an earlier version of Xcode</a>.

## Check your environment

To make sure everything works as expected, install and run the KDoctor tool:

> KDoctor works on macOS only.
>
{type="note"}

1. In the Android Studio terminal or your command-line tool, run the following command to install the tool using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

   If you don't have Homebrew yet, [install it](https://brew.sh/) or see the KDoctor [README](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor#installation) for other ways to install it.
2. After the installation is completed, call KDoctor in the console: 

    ```bash
    kdoctor
    ```

3. If KDoctor diagnoses any problems while checking your environment, review the output for issues and possible solutions:

   * Fix any failed checks (`[x]`). You can find problem descriptions and potential solutions after the `*` symbol.
   * Check the warnings (`[!]`) and successful messages (`[v]`). They may contain useful notes and tips, as well.
   
   > You may ignore KDoctor's warnings regarding the CocoaPods installation. In your first project, you will use a
   > different iOS framework distribution option.
