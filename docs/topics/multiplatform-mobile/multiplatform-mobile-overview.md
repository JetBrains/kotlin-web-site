Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (_KMM_) is an SDK designed to simplify creating cross-platform mobile applications.
With the help of KMM, you can share common code between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only where it’s necessary.
For example, to implement a native UI or when working with platform-specific APIs.

## Get started with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

[Get started with KMM](multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.md) if you're already familiar with the Kotlin language and want to try out Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM).
If you're new to Kotlin, [get started with these tutorials](getting-started.md).

If you want to introduce KMM to your team, look through [our recommendations](multiplatform-mobile-introduce-your-team.md).

## Supported platforms

KMM supports the following mobile targets:

* Android applications and libraries
* [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) on ARM32 and ARM64 platforms
* Apple iOS on ARM64 (iPhone 5s and newer), ARM32 (earlier models) platforms, and desktop simulators on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon platforms
* Apple watchOS on ARM64 (Apple Watch Series 4 and newer), ARM32 (earlier models) platforms, and desktop simulators on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon platforms

KMM is built on top of the [Kotlin Multiplatform](multiplatform.md) technology,
which supports other platforms inlcuding JavaScript, Linux, WebAssembly, and [more](mpp-dsl-reference.md#targets).

See [supported platforms for Kotlin multiplatform programming](mpp-supported-platforms.md).
