You've already created your first cross-platform Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile project! Now let's learn how to add dependencies
to third-party libraries, which is necessary to build successful cross-platform applications.

## Dependency types

There are two types of dependencies that you can use in Multiplatform Mobile projects:

* _Multiplatform dependencies_. These are multiplatform libraries that support multiple targets and can be used in a
  common source set, `commonMain`.

  Many modern Android libraries already have multiplatform
  support, like [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/), [Appolo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [Okio](https://square.github.io/okio/).
* _Native dependencies_. These are regular libraries from relevant ecosystems. You usually work with them in native iOS using CocoaPods or other
  dependency managers and in Android projects using Gradle.

When you work with a shared module, you can also depend on them and use them in native source sets, `androidMain`
and `iosMain`. Typically, you'll need these dependencies when you want to work with platform APIs, for example security
storage, and there is common logic.

For both types of dependencies, you can use local and external repositories.

## Add a multiplatform dependency

> If you have experience developing Android apps, adding a multiplatform dependency looks like adding a
> Gradle dependency in a regular Android Project. The only difference is that you need to specify the source set.

Now go back to the app and make the greeting a little more festive. In addition to the device information, add a
function to display the number of days left until New Year. The `kotlinx-datetime` library, which has full multiplatform
support, is the most convenient way to work with dates in your shared code.

1. Navigate to the `build.gradle.kts` file in the `shared` directory.
2. Add the following dependency to the `commonMain` source set dependencies:

   ```kotlin
   kotlin {
       sourceSets {
           val commonMain by getting {
               dependencies {
                   implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:0.3.3")
               }
           } 
       }
   }
   ```

3. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin`, create a new file `NewYear.kt` and update it with a short function that calculates
the number of days from today until the new year using the `date-time` date arithmetic:
   
   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.datetime.*
   
   fun daysUntilNewYear(): Int {
       val today = Clock.System.todayAt(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
       val closestNewYear = LocalDate(today.year + 1, 1, 1)
       return today.daysUntil(closestNewYear)
   }
   ```

4. In `Greeting.kt`, update the `greeting()` function to see the result:
    
    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        fun greeting(): String {
            return "Guess what it is! > ${Platform().platform.reversed()}!" +
            "\nThere are only ${daysUntilNewYear()} left until New Year! üéÖüèº "
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run the updated application on Android and iOS and see the results:
