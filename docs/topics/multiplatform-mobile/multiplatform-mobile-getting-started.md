Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) is an SDK designed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications.
You can share common code between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only where it's necessary.
Common use cases for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile include implementing a native UI or working with platform-specific APIs.
