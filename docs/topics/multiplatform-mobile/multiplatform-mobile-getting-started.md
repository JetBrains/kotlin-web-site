Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) is an SDK designed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications.
You can share common code between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only where it's necessary.
For example, to implement a native UI or when working with platform-specific APIs.

Watch the introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdN6P6RI__k), in which Kotlin Product Marketing Manager Ekaterina 
Petrova explains what Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is and how to use it in your project. With Ekaterina,
you'll set up an environment and prepare to create your first cross-platform mobile application:
