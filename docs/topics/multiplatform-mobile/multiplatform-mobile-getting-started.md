Kotlin Multiplatform technology simplifies the development of cross-platform projects.
The Kotlin applications will work on different operating systems like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, watchOS, and others.

One of the major Kotlin Multiplatform use cases is sharing code between mobile platforms.
You can share application logic between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only when you need to implement a native UI or work with platform APIs.

[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), a JetBrains' declarative UI framework based on Kotlin
and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), gives you the option to push the sharing capabilities 
of Kotlin Multiplatform beyond application logic. It allows you to implement your user interface once and then use it for all the platforms you target – iOS, Android, desktop, and web.

  to learn about the current state and future plans for the technology.
* See how [different companies](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/case-studies) are already using Kotlin for
  cross-platform app development in production.
* Try [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/),
  JetBrains' declarative UI framework based on Kotlin and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
  to share UIs among iOS, Android, desktop, and web.
