To build the user interface, you'll use the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) toolkit
for the Android part of your project and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) for the iOS one.
These are both declarative UI frameworks, and you'll see similarities in the UI implementations. In both cases,
you store the data in the `phrases` variable and later iterate over it to produce a list of `Text` items.

### Update the Android module

The `androidApp` module contains an Android application, defines its main activity and the UI views, and uses the
`shared` module as a regular Android library. The UI of the application uses the Jetpack Compose framework.

Make some changes and see how it is reflected in the UI:

1. Navigate to the `MainActivity.kt` file in `androidApp`.
2. Find the `Greeting` class invocation. Select the `greet()` function and use the **Cmd + B** shortcut.
   You'll see that it's the same class from the `shared` module you edited in the previous step.
3. In `Greeting.kt`, update the `greet()` function:

    ```kotlin
    fun greet(): List<String> = buildList {
        add(if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!")
        add("Guess what it is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!")
    }
    ```

   Now it returns a list of strings.

4. Go back to `MainActivity.kt`. As you can see, it doesn't compile anymore because the `GreetingView` composable
   expects a `String` argument. Update its definition:

   ```kotlin
   @Composable
   fun GreetingView(phrases: List<String>) {
       LazyColumn(
           contentPadding = PaddingValues(20.dp),
           verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp),
       ) {
           items(phrases) { phrase ->
               Text(phrase)
               Divider()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Here the `LazyColumn` composable shows the list of `Text` items, adds padding around the content and a space between the list items. 
   
5. Follow Android Studio's suggestions to import the missing dependencies.
6. Update the preview as well, passing a list as an argument:
   
   ```kotlin
   @Preview
   @Composable
   fun DefaultPreview() {
       MyApplicationTheme {
           Greeting(listOf("Hello, Android!"))
       }
   }
   ```

7. Now you can run the Android app to ensure it displays the list:

### Work with the iOS module in Xcode

`iosApp` is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the `shared` module as an iOS
framework. The UI of the app is written in Swift.

Implement the same changes as in the Android app:

1. Launch Xcode. Select **Open a project or file**.
2. Navigate to your project, for example **KotlinMultiplatformSandbox**, and select the `iosApp` folder. Click **Open**.
3. In the `ContenView.swift` file, select the `greet()` function and use the **âŒƒ + Cmd** shortcut.

   You'll see the Objective-C declarations for the Kotlin functions defined in the `shared` module. Kotlin types are
   represented as Objective-C types when used from Objective-C/Swift. Here the `greet()` function
   returns `List<String>` in Kotlin and is seen from Swift as returning `NSArray<NSString>`. For more on type mappings,
   see [Interoperability with Swift/Objective-C](native-objc-interop.md).

4. If you try running the project, the build will fail. As in the Android app earlier,
   the Swift code that uses the `greet()` function doesn't compile because its declaration is different now.
   Change the SwiftUI code to display a list of items:

   ```Swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       let phrases = Greeting().greet()
   
       var body: some View {
           List(phrases, id: \.self) {
               Text($0)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

    * The results of the `greet()` call are stored in the `phrases` variable (`let` in Swift is similar to Kotlin's `val`).
    * The `List` function produces a list of `Text` items.

5. Run the app to see the changes:

## Next step

In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn about dependencies and add a third-party library to expand
the functionality of your project.
