[//]: # (title: Equality)

In Kotlin there are two types of equality:

* _Structural_ equality (`==` - a check for `equals()`)
* _Referential_ equality (`===` - two references point to the same object)

## Structural equality

Structural equality is checked by the `==` operation and its negated counterpart `!=`.
By convention, an expression like `a == b` is translated to:

```kotlin
a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null)
```

If `a` is not `null`, it calls the `equals(Any?)` function, otherwise (`a` is `null`) it checks that `b`
is referentially equal to `null`.

Note that there's no point in optimizing your code when comparing to `null` explicitly:
`a == null` will be automatically translated to `a === null`.

To provide a custom equals check implementation, override the
[`equals(other: Any?): Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-any/equals.html) function.
Functions with the same name and other signatures, like `equals(other: Foo)`, don't affect equality checks with
the operators `==` and `!=`.

Structural equality has nothing to do with comparison defined by the `Comparable<...>` interface, so only a custom 
`equals(Any?)` implementation may affect the behavior of the operator. 

## Referential equality

Referential equality is checked by the `===` operation and its negated counterpart `!==`. `a === b` evaluates to
true if and only if `a` and `b` point to the same object. For values represented by primitive types at runtime
(for example, `Int`), the `===` equality check is equivalent to the `==` check.

## Floating-point numbers equality

When an equality check operands are statically known to be `Float` or `Double` (nullable or not), the check follows the 
[IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754). 

Otherwise, the structural equality is used, which disagrees with the standard so that `NaN` is equal to itself, and `-0.0` is not equal to `0.0`.
