This tutorial demonstrates how to run a [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) 
app with Kotlin/Wasm in IntelliJ IDEA, and generate artifacts to publish as a site on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Before you start

1. Download and install the latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
2. Clone the [Kotlin/Wasm examples](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-wasm-examples/tree/main) repository 
  by selecting **File** | **New** | **Project from Version Control** in IntelliJ IDEA.

   You can also clone it from the command line:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Kotlin/kotlin-wasm-examples.git
   ```
   
> Alternatively, you can use our experimental [web wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com/) to download a sample project.

## Run the application

1. Open the **Gradle** tool window by selecting **View** | **Tool Windows** | **Gradle**.

   > You need at least Java 11 as your Gradle JVM for the examples to load successfully.
   >

2. In **compose-example** | **Tasks** | **kotlin browser**, select and run the **wasmJsBrowserRun** task.

    Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal from the `compose-example` directory:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew wasmJsBrowserRun -t
   ```

3. Once the application starts, open the following URL in your browser:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8081/
   ```

   You see a "Hello World!" button. Click it:

   ![Click hello world](wasm-composeapp-browser-hello.png){width=650}

   You see the Compose Multiplatform logo:

## Generate artifacts

In **compose-example** | **Tasks** | **kotlin browser**, select and run the **wasmJsBrowserDistribution** task.

![Run the Gradle task](wasm-gradle-task-window-compose.png){width=650}

Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal from the `compose-example` directory:

```bash
./gradlew wasmJsBrowserDistribution
```
Once the application task completes, you can find the generated artifacts in the `composeApp/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable`
folder:

![Artifacts directory](wasm-composeapp-directory.png){width=600}

## Publish on GitHub pages

1. Copy all the contents in your `productionExecutable` directory into the repository where you want to create a site.
2. Follow GitHub's instructions for [creating your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).

   > It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

   Congratulations! You have published your artifacts on GitHub pages.
