[//]: # (title: Debug Kotlin/Wasm code)

<primary-label ref="beta"/> 

This tutorial demonstrates how to use IntelliJ IDEA and the browser 
to debug your [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
application built with Kotlin/Wasm.

## Before you start

1. [Set up your environment for Kotlin Multiplatform development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/quickstart.html#set-up-the-environment).
2. Follow the instructions to [create a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Kotlin/Wasm](wasm-get-started.md#create-a-project).

> * Debugging Kotlin/Wasm code in IntelliJ IDEA is available starting from version 2025.3 of the IDE, currently in the [Early Access Program (EAP)](https://www.jetbrains.com/resources/eap/)
> and on the way to becoming stable. If you created the
> `WasmDemo` project in a different version of IntelliJ IDEA, switch to version 2025.3 and open the project there
> to continue this tutorial.
> * To debug Kotlin/Wasm code in IntelliJ IDEA, you must have the JavaScript Debugger plugin installed. [See more information
> about the plugin and how to install it.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-javascript-in-chrome.html#ws_js_debugging_chrome_before_you_start)

## Debug in IntelliJ IDEA

The Kotlin Multiplatform project you created contains a Compose Multiplatform application powered by Kotlin/Wasm.
You can debug this application
in IntelliJ IDEA out of the box, without additional configuration.

1. In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Kotlin file to debug. In this tutorial, we'll work with the `Greeting.kt` file from the following directory
   of the Kotlin Multiplatform project:

   `WasmDemo/composeApp/src/wasmJsMain/kotlin/wasm.project.demo.wasmdemo`

2. Click on the line numbers to set breakpoints on the code that you want to inspect.

3. In the list of run configurations, select **composeApp[wasmJs]**.
4. Run the code in debug mode by clicking the debug icon at the top of the screen.

   Once the application starts, it opens in a new browser window.

   Also, the **Debug** panel opens automatically in IntelliJ IDEA.

### Inspect your application

> If you're [debugging in your browser](#debug-in-your-browser), you can follow the same steps for inspecting your application.

{style="note"}

1. In the application's browser window, click on the **Click me!** button to interact with the application. This action triggers the execution of the
   code, and the debugger pauses when the execution reaches a breakpoint.

2. In the debugging pane, use the debugging control buttons to inspect variables and code execution at the breakpoints:
    * ![Step over](wasm-debug-step-over.png){width=30}{type="joined"} Step over to execute the current line and pause on the next line.
    * ![Step into](wasm-debug-step-into.png){width=30}{type="joined"} Step into to investigate a function more deeply.
    * ![Step out](wasm-debug-step-out.png){width=30}{type="joined"} Step out to execute the code until it exits the current function.

3. Check the **Threads & Variables** pane. It helps you trace the sequence of function calls and pinpoint the location of any errors.

4. Make changes to your code and run the application again to verify how it works.
5. When you're done debugging, click on the line numbers with breakpoints to remove the breakpoints.

## Debug in your browser

You can also debug this Compose Multiplatform application
in your browser without additional configuration. 

When you run development Gradle tasks (`*DevRun`), Kotlin automatically serves the source files to the browser,
allowing you to set breakpoints, inspect variables,
and step through Kotlin code.

The configuration to serve the Kotlin/Wasm project sources in the browser is now included in the Kotlin Gradle plugin.
If you previously added this configuration
to your `build.gradle.kts` file, you should remove it to avoid conflicts.

> This tutorial uses the Chrome browser, but you should be able to follow these steps with other browsers. For more information,
> see [Browser versions](wasm-configuration.md#browser-versions).

1. Follow the instructions to [run the Compose Multiplatform application](wasm-get-started.md#run-the-application).

2. In the application's browser window, right-click and select the **Inspect** action to access developer tools.
   Alternatively, you can use the **F12** shortcut or select **View** | **Developer** | **Developer Tools**.

3. Switch to the **Sources** tab and select the Kotlin file to debug. In this tutorial, we'll work with the `Greeting.kt` file.

4. Click on the line numbers to set breakpoints on the code that you want to inspect. Only the lines
   with darker numbers can have breakpoints â€” in this example, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

5. Inspect your application similar to [debugging in IntelliJ IDEA](#inspect-your-application).

    When debugging in your browser, the panes to trace the sequence of function
    calls and pinpoint any errors are **Scope** and **Call Stack**.

### Use custom formatters

Custom formatters help display and locate variable values in a more user-friendly and comprehensible manner when debugging Kotlin/Wasm code
in your browser.

Custom formatters are enabled by default in Kotlin/Wasm development builds, but
you still need to ensure that custom formatters are enabled in your browser's developer tools:

* In Chrome DevTools, find the **Custom formatters** checkbox in **Settings | Preferences | Console**:

  ![Enable custom formatters in Chrome](wasm-custom-formatters-chrome.png){width=400}

* In Firefox DevTools, find the **Enable custom formatters** checkbox in **Settings | Advanced settings**:

  ![Enable custom formatters in Firefox](wasm-custom-formatters-firefox.png){width=400}

This feature uses the [custom formatters API](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/custom_formatters/index.html),
and is supported in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

Given that custom formatters work by default only for Kotlin/Wasm development builds,
you need to adjust your Gradle configuration if you want to use them for production builds.
Add the following compiler option to the `wasmJs {}` block:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    wasmJs {
        // ...

        compilerOptions {
            freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwasm-debugger-custom-formatters")
        }
    }
}
```
