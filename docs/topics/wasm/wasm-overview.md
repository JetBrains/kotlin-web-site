[WebAssembly (Wasm)](webassembly.org) is a binary format for a virtual machine that can run in web browsers.
It is platform-independent because it runs on its own virtual machine.
Wasm is designed to be fast and secure, and it can compile code from various programming languages, including Kotlin.

Kotlin/Wasm is a new compilation target for Kotlin. 
With Kotlin/Wasm, you can take advantage of the benefits of WebAssembly to write web applications that are capable of running on a variety of environments and devices.

Kotlin features a new experimental Kotlin/Wasm compiler that provides several advantages:

* Faster compilation speeds than the deprecated `wasm32` Kotlin/Native target since Kotlin/Wasm doesn't rely on LLVM.
* Improved interoperability with JavaScript and better integration with browsers, thanks to the [Wasm garbage collection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) feature.
* Potentially faster application startup compared to Kotlin/JS and JavaScript because Wasm has a compact and easy-to-parse bytecode.
* Improved application runtime performance compared to Kotlin/JS and JavaScript because Wasm is a statically typed language.

You can use Kotlin standard library (`stdlib`) and test library (`kotlin.test`) for Kotlin/Wasm out of the box.

[Learn more about Kotlin/Wasm in our YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pqz9sKXatw).

## Browser support

Almost all modern browsers already support WebAssembly 1.0.
To set up the environment to run WebAssembly, you only need to enable an experimental [garbage collection feature](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc).

## Interoperability

Kotlin/Wasm allows you to both use JavaScript code from Kotlin and Kotlin code from JavaScript.

## Compose Multiplatform for Web 

> Web support is [Experimental](components-stability.md) and may be changed at any time. Use it only for evaluation purposes.
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in the public Slack channel [#compose-web](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/compose-web).

Compose Multiplatform for Web is based on new Kotlin/Wasm target.
You can create a Kotlin Multiplatform project and experiment with sharing your mobile or desktop UIs with the web.
With Compose Multiplatform for Web, you can run your code in the browser with all the benefits of WebAssembly.

## How to get started

* [Get started with Kotlin/Wasm in IntelliJ IDEA](wasm-get-started.md)
