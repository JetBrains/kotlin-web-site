[//]: # (title: Scope functions)

The Kotlin standard library contains several functions whose sole purpose is to execute a block of code within the context
of an object. When you call such a function on an object with a [lambda expression](lambdas.md) provided, it forms a
temporary scope. In this scope, you can access the object without its name. Such functions are called _scope functions_.
There are five of them: `let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, and `also`.

Basically, these functions do the same: execute a block of code on an object. What's different is how this object becomes
available inside the block and what is the result of the whole expression.

Here's a typical usage of a scope function:

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int, var city: String) {
    fun moveTo(newCity: String) { city = newCity }
    fun incrementAge() { age++ }
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    Person("Alice", 20, "Amsterdam").let {
        println(it)
        it.moveTo("London")
        it.incrementAge()
        println(it)
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```

If you write the same without `let`, you'll have to introduce a new variable and repeat its name whenever you use it. 

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int, var city: String) {
    fun moveTo(newCity: String) { city = newCity }
    fun incrementAge() { age++ }
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val alice = Person("Alice", 20, "Amsterdam")
    println(alice)
    alice.moveTo("London")
    alice.incrementAge()
    println(alice)
//sampleEnd
}
```

The scope functions do not introduce any new technical capabilities, but they can make your code more concise and readable.

Due to the similar nature of scope functions, choosing the right one for your case can be a bit tricky. The choice mainly
depends on your intent and the consistency of use in your project. Below we'll provide detailed descriptions of the
distinctions between scope functions and the conventions on their usage.

## Function selection

To help you choose the right scope function for your purpose, we provide the table of key differences between them.

|Function|Object reference|Return value|Is extension function|
|---|---|---|---|
|`let`|`it`|Lambda result|Yes|
|`run`|`this`|Lambda result|Yes|
|`run`|-|Lambda result|No: called without the context object|
|`with`|`this`|Lambda result|No: takes the context object as an argument.|
|`apply`|`this`|Context object|Yes|
|`also`|`it`|Context object|Yes|

The detailed information about the differences is provided in the dedicated sections below.

Here is a short guide for choosing scope functions depending on the intended purpose:

* Executing a lambda on non-null objects: `let`
* Introducing an expression as a variable in local scope: `let`
* Object configuration: `apply`
* Object configuration and computing the result: `run`
* Running statements where an expression is required: non-extension `run`
* Additional effects: `also`
* Grouping function calls on an object: `with`

The use cases of different functions overlap, so that you can choose the functions based on the specific conventions used
in your project or team.

Although the scope functions are a way of making the code more concise, avoid overusing them: it can decrease your code
readability and lead to errors. Avoid nesting scope functions and be careful when chaining them: it's easy to get confused
about the current context object and the value of `this` or `it`.

## Distinctions

Because the scope functions are all quite similar in nature, it's important to understand the differences between them.
There are two main differences between each scope function: 
* The way to refer to the context object
* The return value.

### Context object: this or it

Inside the lambda of a scope function, the context object is available by a short reference instead of its actual name.
Each scope function uses one of two ways to access the context object: as a lambda [receiver](lambdas.md#function-literals-with-receiver)
(`this`) or as a lambda argument (`it`). Both provide the same capabilities, so we'll describe the pros and cons of each
for different cases and provide recommendations on their use.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val str = "Hello"
    // this
    str.run {
        println("The receiver string length: $length")
        //println("The receiver string length: ${this.length}") // does the same
    }

    // it
    str.let {
        println("The receiver string's length is ${it.length}")
    }
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

#### this

`run`, `with`, and `apply` refer to the context object as a lambda receiver - by keyword `this`. Hence, in their lambdas,
the object is available as it would be in ordinary class functions. In most cases, you can omit `this` when accessing
the members of the receiver object, making the code shorter. On the other hand, if `this` is omitted, it can be hard to
distinguish between the receiver members and external objects or functions. So, having the context object as a receiver
(`this`) is recommended for lambdas that mainly operate on the object members: call its functions or assign properties.

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int = 0, var city: String = "")

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val adam = Person("Adam").apply { 
        age = 20                       // same as this.age = 20 or adam.age = 20
        city = "London"
    }
    println(adam)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

#### it

In turn, `let` and `also` have the context object as a lambda argument. If the argument name is not specified, the object
is accessed by the implicit default name `it`. `it` is shorter than `this` and expressions with `it` are usually easier
for reading. However, when calling the object functions or properties you don't have the object available implicitly like
`this`. Hence, having the context object as `it` is better when the object is mostly used as an argument in function calls.
`it` is also better if you use multiple variables in the code block.

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random

fun writeToLog(message: String) {
    println("INFO: $message")
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun getRandomInt(): Int {
        return Random.nextInt(100).also {
            writeToLog("getRandomInt() generated value $it")
        }
    }
    
    val i = getRandomInt()
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Additionally, when you pass the context object as an argument, you can provide a custom name for the context object inside
the scope.

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random

fun writeToLog(message: String) {
    println("INFO: $message")
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun getRandomInt(): Int {
        return Random.nextInt(100).also { value ->
            writeToLog("getRandomInt() generated value $value")
        }
    }
    
    val i = getRandomInt()
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### Return value

The scope functions differ by the result they return:
* `apply` and `also` return the context object.
* `let`, `run`, and `with` return the lambda result.

These two options let you choose the proper function depending on what you do next in your code.

#### Context object 

The return value of `apply` and `also` is the context object itself. Hence, they can be included into call chains as
_side steps_: you can continue chaining function calls on the same object after them.  

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numberList = mutableListOf<Double>()
    numberList.also { println("Populating the list") }
        .apply {
            add(2.71)
            add(3.14)
            add(1.0)
        }
        .also { println("Sorting the list") }
        .sort()
//sampleEnd
    println(numberList)
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

They also can be used in return statements of functions returning the context object.

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.Random

fun writeToLog(message: String) {
    println("INFO: $message")
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun getRandomInt(): Int {
        return Random.nextInt(100).also {
            writeToLog("getRandomInt() generated value $it")
        }
    }
    
    val i = getRandomInt()
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

#### Lambda result

`let`, `run`, and `with` return the lambda result. So, you can use them when assigning the result to a variable, chaining
operations on the result, and so on.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three")
    val countEndsWithE = numbers.run { 
        add("four")
        add("five")
        count { it.endsWith("e") }
    }
    println("There are $countEndsWithE elements that end with e.")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Additionally, you can ignore the return value and use a scope function to create a temporary scope for variables. 

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three")
    with(numbers) {
        val firstItem = first()
        val lastItem = last()        
        println("First item: $firstItem, last item: $lastItem")
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

## Functions

To help you choose the right scope function for your case, we'll describe them in detail and provide usage recommendations.
Technically, functions are interchangeable in many cases, so the examples show the conventions that define the common usage style. 

### let

**The context object** is available as an argument (`it`). **The return value** is the lambda result.

`let` can be used to invoke one or more functions on results of call chains. For example, the following code prints the
results of two operations on a collection:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
    val resultList = numbers.map { it.length }.filter { it > 3 }
    println(resultList)    
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

With `let`, you can rewrite it:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
    numbers.map { it.length }.filter { it > 3 }.let { 
        println(it)
        // and more function calls if needed
    } 
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

If the code block contains a single function with `it` as an argument, you can use the method reference (`::`) instead of
the lambda:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
    numbers.map { it.length }.filter { it > 3 }.let(::println)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

`let` is often used for executing a code block only with non-null values. To perform actions on a non-null object, use
the safe call operator `?.` on it and call `let` with the actions in its lambda.

```kotlin
fun processNonNullString(str: String) {}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val str: String? = "Hello"   
    //processNonNullString(str)       // compilation error: str can be null
    val length = str?.let { 
        println("let() called on $it")        
        processNonNullString(it)      // OK: 'it' is not null inside '?.let { }'
        it.length
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Another case for using `let` is introducing local variables with a limited scope for improving code readability.
To define a new variable for the context object, provide its name as the lambda argument so that it can be used instead of
the default `it`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = listOf("one", "two", "three", "four")
    val modifiedFirstItem = numbers.first().let { firstItem ->
        println("The first item of the list is '$firstItem'")
        if (firstItem.length >= 5) firstItem else "!" + firstItem + "!"
    }.uppercase()
    println("First item after modifications: '$modifiedFirstItem'")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### with

A non-extension function: **the context object** is passed as an argument, but inside the lambda, it's available as a
receiver (`this`). **The return value** is the lambda result. 

We recommend `with` for calling functions on the context object without providing the lambda result. In the code, `with`
can be read as “_with this object, do the following._”

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three")
    with(numbers) {
        println("'with' is called with argument $this")
        println("It contains $size elements")
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Another use case for `with` is introducing a helper object whose properties or functions will be used for calculating a value.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three")
    val firstAndLast = with(numbers) {
        "The first element is ${first()}," +
        " the last element is ${last()}"
    }
    println(firstAndLast)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### run

**The context object** is available as a receiver (`this`). **The return value** is the lambda result.

`run` does the same as `with` but invokes as `let` - as an extension function of the context object.

`run` is useful when your lambda contains both the object initialization and the computation of the return value.

```kotlin
class MultiportService(var url: String, var port: Int) {
    fun prepareRequest(): String = "Default request"
    fun query(request: String): String = "Result for query '$request'"
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val service = MultiportService("https://example.kotlinlang.org", 80)

    val result = service.run {
        port = 8080
        query(prepareRequest() + " to port $port")
    }
    
    // the same code written with let() function:
    val letResult = service.let {
        it.port = 8080
        it.query(it.prepareRequest() + " to port ${it.port}")
    }
//sampleEnd
    println(result)
    println(letResult)
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Besides calling `run` on a receiver object, you can use it as a non-extension function. Non-extension `run` lets you execute
a block of several statements where an expression is required.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val hexNumberRegex = run {
        val digits = "0-9"
        val hexDigits = "A-Fa-f"
        val sign = "+-"
        
        Regex("[$sign]?[$digits$hexDigits]+")
    }
    
    for (match in hexNumberRegex.findAll("+1234 -FFFF not-a-number")) {
        println(match.value)
    }
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

### apply

**The context object** is available as a receiver (`this`). **The return value** is the object itself.

Use `apply` for code blocks that don't return a value and mainly operate on the members of the receiver object. The common
case for `apply` is the object configuration. Such calls can be read as “_apply the following assignments to the object._”

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int = 0, var city: String = "")

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val adam = Person("Adam").apply {
        age = 32
        city = "London"        
    }
    println(adam)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

Having the receiver as the return value, you can easily include `apply` into call chains for more complex processing.

### also

**The context object** is available as an argument (`it`). **The return value** is the object itself.

`also` is good for performing some actions that take the context object as an argument. Use `also` for actions that need
a reference rather to the object than to its properties and functions, or when you don't want to shadow `this` reference
from an outer scope.

When you see `also` in the code, you can read it as “_and also do the following with the object._”

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val numbers = mutableListOf("one", "two", "three")
    numbers
        .also { println("The list elements before adding new one: $it") }
        .add("four")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

## takeIf and takeUnless

In addition to scope functions, the standard library contains the functions `takeIf` and `takeUnless`. These functions
let you embed checks of the object state in call chains. 

When called on an object with a predicate provided, `takeIf` returns this object if it matches the predicate.
Otherwise, it returns `null`. So, `takeIf` is a filtering function for a single object. In turn, `takeUnless` returns
the object if it doesn't match the predicate and `null` if it does. The object is available as a lambda argument (`it`).

```kotlin
import kotlin.random.*

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val number = Random.nextInt(100)

    val evenOrNull = number.takeIf { it % 2 == 0 }
    val oddOrNull = number.takeUnless { it % 2 == 0 }
    println("even: $evenOrNull, odd: $oddOrNull")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

When chaining other functions after `takeIf` and `takeUnless`, don't forget to perform the null check or the safe call
(`?.`) because their return value is nullable.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val str = "Hello"
    val caps = str.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() }?.uppercase()
   //val caps = str.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() }.uppercase() //compilation error
    println(caps)
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

`takeIf` and `takeUnless` are especially useful together with scope functions. A good case is chaining them with `let`
for running a code block on objects that match the given predicate. To do this, call `takeIf` on the object and then call
`let` with a safe call (`?`). For objects that don't match the predicate, `takeIf` returns `null` and `let` isn't invoked.

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun displaySubstringPosition(input: String, sub: String) {
        input.indexOf(sub).takeIf { it >= 0 }?.let {
            println("The substring $sub is found in $input.")
            println("Its start position is $it.")
        }
    }

    displaySubstringPosition("010000011", "11")
    displaySubstringPosition("010000011", "12")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}

This is how the same function looks without the standard library functions:

```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    fun displaySubstringPosition(input: String, sub: String) {
        val index = input.indexOf(sub)
        if (index >= 0) {
            println("The substring $sub is found in $input.")
            println("Its start position is $index.")
        }
    }

    displaySubstringPosition("010000011", "11")
    displaySubstringPosition("010000011", "12")
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}
