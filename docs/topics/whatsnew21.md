[//]: # (title: What's new in Kotlin 2.1.0)

_[Released: November 27, 2024](releases.md#release-details)_

## IDE support

The Kotlin plugins that support 2.1.0 are bundled in the latest IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio.
You don't need to update the Kotlin plugin in your IDE.
All you need to do is [change the Kotlin version](configure-build-for-eap.md) to 2.1.0 in your build scripts.

See [Update to a new Kotlin version](releases.md#update-to-a-new-kotlin-version) for details.

## Documentation updates

The Kotlin documentation has received some notable changes:

## Install Kotlin 2.1.0

Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3 and Android Studio Iguana (2023.2.1) Canary 15, the Kotlin plugin is distributed as a
bundled plugin included in your IDE. This means that you can't install the plugin from JetBrains Marketplace anymore.

To update to the new Kotlin version, [change the Kotlin version](releases.md#update-to-a-new-kotlin-version)
to 2.1.0 in your build scripts.
