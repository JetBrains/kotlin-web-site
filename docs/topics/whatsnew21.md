Starting from 2.1.0, you can use guard conditions in `when` expressions or statements with subjects.

Guard conditions allow you to include more than one condition for the branches of a `when` expression,
making complex control flows more explicit and concise as well as flattening the code structure.

To include a guard condition in a branch, place it after the primary condition, separated by `if`:

```kotlin
sealed interface Animal {
    data class Cat(val mouseHunter: Boolean) : Animal {
        fun feedCat() {}
    }

    data class Dog(val breed: String) : Animal {
        fun feedDog() {}
    }
}

fun feedAnimal(animal: Animal) {
    when (animal) {
        // Branch with only the primary condition. Returns `feedDog()` when `Animal` is `Dog`
        is Animal.Dog -> animal.feedDog()
        // Branch with both primary and guard conditions. Returns `feedCat()` when `Animal` is `Cat` and is not `mouseHunter`
        is Animal.Cat if !animal.mouseHunter -> animal.feedCat()
        // Returns "Unknown animal" if none of the above conditions match
        else -> println("Unknown animal")
    }
}
```

In a single `when` expression, you can combine branches with and without guard conditions.
The code in a branch with a guard condition runs only if both the primary condition and the guard condition are `true`.
If the primary condition does not match, the guard condition is not evaluated. 
Additionally, guard conditions support `else if`.

To enable guard conditions in your project, use the following compiler option in the command line:

```bash
kotlinc -Xwhen-guards main.kt
```

Or add it to the `compilerOptions {}` block of your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    compilerOptions {
        freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwhen-guards")
    }
}
```

### Non-local break and continue

Kotlin 2.1.0 adds a preview of another long-awaited feature, the ability to use non-local `break` and `continue`.
This feature expands the toolset you can use in the scope of inline functions and reduces boilerplate code in your project.

Previously, you could use only non-local returns.
Now, Kotlin also supports `break` and `continue` [jump expressions](returns.md) non-locally.
This means that you can apply them within lambdas passed as arguments to an inline function that encloses the loop:

```kotlin
fun processList(elements: List<Int>): Boolean {
    for (element in elements) {
        val variable = element.nullableMethod() ?: run {
            log.warning("Element is null or invalid, continuing...")
            continue
        }
        if (variable == 0) return true // If variable is zero, return true
    }
    return false
}
```

To try the feature in your project, use the `-Xnon-local-break-continue` compiler option in the command line:

```bash
kotlinc -Xnon-local-break-continue main.kt
```

Or add it in the `compilerOptions {}` block of your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    compilerOptions {
        freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xnon-local-break-continue")
    }
}
```

We're planning to make this feature Stable in future Kotlin releases. 
If you encounter any issues when using non-local `break` and `continue`, 
please report them to our [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-1436).

### Multi-dollar string interpolation

> The feature is [In preview](kotlin-evolution-principles.md#pre-stable-features)

Kotlin 2.1.0 introduces support for multi-dollar string interpolation, 
improving how the dollar sign (`$`) is handled within string literals.
This feature is helpful in contexts that require multiple dollar signs,
such as templating engines, JSON schemas, or other data formats.

String interpolation in Kotlin uses a single dollar sign. 
However, using a literal dollar sign in a string, 
which is common in financial data and templating systems, required workarounds such as `${'$'}`.
With the multi-dollar interpolation feature enabled, you can configure how many dollar signs trigger interpolation, 
with fewer dollar signs being treated as string literals.

Here's an example of how to generate an JSON schema multi-line string with placeholders using `$`:

```kotlin
val KClass<*>.jsonSchema : String
    get() = $$"""
    {
      "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
      "$id": "https://example.com/product.schema.json",
      "$dynamicAnchor": "meta"
      "title": "$${simpleName ?: qualifiedName ?: "unknown"}",
      "type": "object"
    }
    """
```

In this example, the initial `$$` means that you need **two dollar signs** (`$$`) to trigger interpolation.
It prevents `$schema`, `$id`, and `$dynamicAnchor` from being interpreted as interpolation markers.

This approach is especially helpful when working with systems that use dollar signs for placeholder syntax.

To enable the feature, use the following compiler option in the command line:

```bash
kotlinc -Xmulti-dollar-interpolation main.kt
```

Alternatively, update the `compilerOptions {}` block of your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    compilerOptions {
        freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xmulti-dollar-interpolation")
    }
}
```

If your code already uses standard string interpolation with a single dollar sign, no changes are needed.
You can use `$$` whenever you need literal dollar signs in your strings.

### Support for requiring opt-in to extend APIs

Kotlin 2.1.0 introduces the [`@SubclassOptInRequired`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-subclass-opt-in-required/) annotation,
which allows library authors to require an explicit opt-in before users can implement experimental interfaces or extend experimental classes.

This feature can be useful when a library API is stable enough to use but might evolve with new abstract functions,
making it unstable for inheritance.

To add the opt-in requirement to an API element, use the `@SubclassOptInRequired`
annotation with a reference to the annotation class:

```kotlin
@RequiresOptIn(
level = RequiresOptIn.Level.WARNING,
message = "Interfaces in this library are experimental"
)
annotation class UnstableApi()

@SubclassOptInRequired(UnstableApi::class)
interface CoreLibraryApi
```

In this example, the `CoreLibraryApi` interface requires users to opt in before they can implement it.
A user can opt in like this:

```kotlin
@OptIn(UnstableApi::class)
interface MyImplementation: CoreLibraryApi
```

> When you use the `@SubclassOptInRequired` annotation to require opt-in, 
> the requirement is not propagated to any [inner or nested classes](nested-classes.md).
>
{style="note"}

For a real-world example of how to use the `@SubclassOptInRequired` annotation in your API,
check out the [`SharedFlow`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-shared-flow/)
interface in the `kotlinx.coroutines` library.

### Improved overload resolution for functions with generic types

Previously, if you had a number of overloads for a function where some had value parameters of a generic type
and others had function types in the same position, the resolution behavior could sometimes be inconsistent.

This led to different behavior depending on whether your overloads were member functions or extension functions.
For example:

```kotlin
class KeyValueStore<K, V> {
    fun store(key: K, value: V) {} // 1
    fun store(key: K, lazyValue: () -> V) {} // 2
}

fun <K, V> KeyValueStore<K, V>.storeExtension(key: K, value: V) {} // 1 
fun <K, V> KeyValueStore<K, V>.storeExtension(key: K, lazyValue: () -> V) {} // 2

fun test(kvs: KeyValueStore<String, Int>) {
    // Member functions
    kvs.store("", 1)    // Resolves to 1
    kvs.store("") { 1 } // Resolves to 2

    // Extension functions
    kvs.storeExtension("", 1)    // Resolves to 1
    kvs.storeExtension("") { 1 } // Doesn't resolve
}
```

In this example, the `KeyValueStore` class has two overloads for the `store()` function,
where one overload has function parameters with generic types `K` and `V`,
and another has a lambda function that returns a generic type `V`.
Similarly, there are two overloads for the extension function: `storeExtension()`.

When the `store()` function was called with and without a lambda function,
the compiler successfully resolved the correct overloads.
However, when the extension function `storeExtension()` was called with a lambda function,
the compiler didn't resolve the correct overload because it incorrectly considered both overloads to be applicable.

To fix this problem, we've introduced a new heuristic so that the compiler can discard a possible overload
when a function parameter with a generic type can't accept a lambda function based on information from a different argument.
This change makes the behavior of member functions and extension functions consistent,
and it is enabled by default in Kotlin 2.1.0.

### Improved exhaustiveness checks for when expressions with sealed classes

In previous versions of Kotlin, the compiler required an `else` branch in `when`
expressions for type parameters with sealed upper bounds, even when all cases in the `sealed class` hierarchy were covered.
This behavior is addressed and improved in Kotlin 2.1.0,
making exhaustiveness checks more powerful and allowing you to remove redundant `else` branches,
keeping `when` expressions cleaner and more intuitive.

Here's an example demonstrating the change:

```kotlin
sealed class Result
object Error: Result()
class Success(val value: String): Result()

fun <T : Result> render(result: T) = when (result) {
    Error -> "Error!"
    is Success -> result.value
    // Requires no else branch
}
```

## Kotlin K2 compiler

With Kotlin 2.1.0, the K2 compiler now provides [more flexibility when working with compiler checks](#extra-compiler-checks)
and [warnings](#global-warning-suppression), as well as [improved support for the kapt plugin](#improved-k2-kapt-implementation).

### Extra compiler checks

With Kotlin 2.1.0, you can now enable additional checks in the K2 compiler.
These are extra declaration, expression, and type checks that are usually not crucial for compilation
but can still be useful if you want to validate the following cases:

| Check type                                            | Comment                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REDUNDANT_NULLABLE`                                  | `Boolean??` is used instead of `Boolean?`                                                |
| `PLATFORM_CLASS_MAPPED_TO_KOTLIN`                     | `java.lang.String` is used instead of `kotlin.String`                                    |
| `ARRAY_EQUALITY_OPERATOR_CAN_BE_REPLACED_WITH_EQUALS` | `arrayOf("") == arrayOf("")` is used instead of `arrayOf("").contentEquals(arrayOf(""))` |
| `REDUNDANT_CALL_OF_CONVERSION_METHOD`                 | `42.toInt()` is used instead of `42`                                                     |
| `USELESS_CALL_ON_NOT_NULL`                            | `"".orEmpty()` is used instead of `""`                                                   |
| `REDUNDANT_SINGLE_EXPRESSION_STRING_TEMPLATE`         | `"$string"` is used instead of `string`                                                  |
| `UNUSED_ANONYMOUS_PARAMETER`                          | A parameter is passed in the lambda expression but never used                            |
| `REDUNDANT_VISIBILITY_MODIFIER`                       | `public class Klass` is used instead of `class Klass`                                    |
| `REDUNDANT_MODALITY_MODIFIER`                         | `final class Klass` is used instead of `class Klass`                                     |
| `REDUNDANT_SETTER_PARAMETER_TYPE`                     | `set(value: Int)` is used instead of `set(value)`                                        |
| `CAN_BE_VAL`                                          | `var local = 0` is defined but never reassigned, can be `val local = 42` instead         |
| `ASSIGNED_VALUE_IS_NEVER_READ`                        | `val local = 42` is defined but never used afterward in the code                         |
| `UNUSED_VARIABLE`                                     | `val local = 0` is defined but never used in the code                                    |
| `REDUNDANT_RETURN_UNIT_TYPE`                          | `fun foo(): Unit {}` is used instead of `fun foo() {}`                                   |
| `UNREACHABLE_CODE`                                    | Code statement is present but can never be executed                                      |

If the check is true, you'll receive a compiler warning with a suggestion on how to fix the problem.

Extra checks are disabled by default.
To enable them, use the `-Wextra` compiler option in the command line or specify `extraWarnings`
in the `compilerOptions {}` block of your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    compilerOptions {
        extraWarnings.set(true)
    }
}
```

For more information on how to define and use compiler options,
see [Compiler options in the Kotlin Gradle plugin](gradle-compiler-options.md).

### Global warning suppression

In 2.1.0, the Kotlin compiler has received a highly requested feature – the ability to suppress warnings globally.

You can now suppress specific warnings in the whole project by using the `-Xsuppress-warning=WARNING_NAME`
syntax in the command line or the `freeCompilerArgs` attribute in the `compilerOptions {}` block of your build file.

For example, if you have [extra compiler checks](#extra-compiler-checks) enabled in your project but want to suppress one of them, use:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    compilerOptions {
        extraWarnings.set(true)
        freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xsuppress-warning=CAN_BE_VAL")
    }
}
```

If you want to suppress a warning but don't know its name, select the element and click the light bulb icon (or use <shortcut>Cmd + Enter</shortcut>/<shortcut>Alt + Enter</shortcut>):

![Warning name intention](warning-name-intention.png){width=500}

The new compiler option is currently [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
The following details are also worth noting:

* Error suppression is not allowed.
* If you pass an unknown warning name, compilation will result in an error.
* You can specify several warnings at once:
  
   <tabs>
   <tab title="Command line">

   ```bash
   kotlinc -Xsuppress-warning=NOTHING_TO_INLINE -Xsuppress-warning=NO_TAIL_CALLS_FOUND main.kt
   ```

   </tab>
   <tab title="Build file">

   ```kotlin
   // build.gradle.kts
   kotlin {
       compilerOptions {
           freeCompilerArgs.addAll(
               listOf(
                   "-Xsuppress-warning=NOTHING_TO_INLINE",
                   "-Xsuppress-warning=NO_TAIL_CALLS_FOUND"
               )
           )
       }
   }
   ```

   </tab>
   </tabs>

### Improved K2 kapt implementation

> The kapt plugin for the K2 compiler (K2 kapt) is in [Alpha](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> It may be changed at any time.
> 
> We would appreciate your feedback in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71439/K2-kapt-feedback).
>
{style="warning"}

Currently, projects using the [kapt](kapt.md) plugin work with the K1 compiler by default, 
supporting Kotlin versions up to 1.9.

In Kotlin 1.9.20, we launched an experimental implementation of the kapt plugin with the K2 compiler (K2 kapt).
We have now improved K2 kapt's internal implementation to mitigate technical and performance issues.

While the new K2 kapt implementation doesn't introduce new features,
its performance has significantly improved compared to the previous K2 kapt implementation.
Additionally, the K2 kapt plugin's behavior is now much closer to that of K1 kapt.

To use the new K2 kapt plugin implementation, enable it just like you did the previous K2 kapt plugin.
Add the following option to the `gradle.properties` file of your project:

```kotlin
kapt.use.k2=true
```

In upcoming releases, the K2 kapt implementation will be enabled by default instead of K1 kapt,
so you will no longer need to enable it manually.

We highly appreciate your [feedback](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71439/K2-kapt-feedback) before the new implementation is stabilized.

### Resolution for overload conflicts between unsigned and non-primitive types

This release addresses the issue of resolution for overload conflicts
that could occur in previous versions when functions were overloaded for unsigned and non-primitive types,
as in the following examples:

#### Overloaded extension functions

```kotlin
fun Any.doStuff() = "Any"
fun UByte.doStuff() = "UByte"

fun main() {
    val uByte: UByte = UByte.MIN_VALUE
    uByte.doStuff() // Overload resolution ambiguity before Kotlin 2.1.0
}
```

In earlier versions, calling `uByte.doStuff()` led to ambiguity because both the `Any` and `UByte` extensions were applicable.

#### Overloaded top-level functions

```kotlin
fun doStuff(value: Any) = "Any"
fun doStuff(value: UByte) = "UByte"

fun main() {
    val uByte: UByte = UByte.MIN_VALUE
    doStuff(uByte) // Overload resolution ambiguity before Kotlin 2.1.0
}
```

Similarly, the call to `doStuff(uByte)` was ambiguous because the compiler couldn't decide whether to use the `Any` or `UByte` version.
With 2.1.0, the compiler now handles these cases correctly, resolving the ambiguity by giving precedence to the more specific type,
in this case `UByte`.

## Kotlin/JVM

Starting with version 2.1.0, the compiler can generate classes containing Java 23 bytecode.

### Change of JSpecify nullability mismatch diagnostics severity to strict

Kotlin 2.1.0 enforces strict handling of nullability annotations from `org.jspecify.annotations`,
improving type safety for Java interoperability.

The following nullability annotations are affected:

* `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable`
* `org.jspecify.annotations.NonNull`
* `org.jspecify.annotations.NullMarked`
* Legacy annotations in `org.jspecify.nullness` (JSpecify 0.2 and earlier)

Starting from Kotlin 2.1.0, nullability mismatches are raised from warnings to errors by default.
This ensures that annotations like `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` are enforced during type checks,
preventing unexpected nullability issues at runtime.

The `@NullMarked` annotation also affects the nullability of all members within its scope,
making the behavior more predictable when you're working with annotated Java code.

Here's an example demonstrating the new default behavior:

```java
// Java
import org.jspecify.annotations.*;
public class SomeJavaClass {
    @NonNull
    public String foo() { //...
    }

    @Nullable
    public String bar() { //...
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
fun test(sjc: SomeJavaClass) {
    // Accesses a non-null result, which is allowed
    sjc.foo().length

    // Raises an error in the default strict mode because the result is nullable
    // To avoid the error, use ?.length instead
    sjc.bar().length
}
```

You can manually control the severity of diagnostics for these annotations.
To do so, use the `-Xnullability-annotations` compiler option to choose a mode:

* `ignore`: Ignore nullability mismatches.
* `warning`: Report warnings for nullability mismatches.
* `strict`: Report errors for nullability mismatches (default mode).

For more information, see [Nullability annotations](java-interop.md#nullability-annotations).

## Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin 2.1.0 introduces [basic support for Swift export](#basic-support-for-swift-export) and makes
[publishing Kotlin Multiplatform libraries easier](#ability-to-publish-kotlin-libraries-from-any-host).
It also focuses on improvements around Gradle that stabilize the [new DSL for configuring compiler options](#new-gradle-dsl-for-compiler-options-in-multiplatform-projects-promoted-to-stable)
and bring a [preview of the Isolated Projects feature](#preview-gradle-s-isolated-projects-in-kotlin-multiplatform).

### New Gradle DSL for compiler options in multiplatform projects promoted to Stable

In Kotlin 2.0.0, [we introduced a new Experimental Gradle DSL](whatsnew20.md#new-gradle-dsl-for-compiler-options-in-multiplatform-projects)
to simplify the configuration of compiler options across your multiplatform projects.
In Kotlin 2.1.0, this DSL has been promoted to Stable.

The overall project configuration now has three layers. The highest is the extension level, 
then the target level, and the lowest is the compilation unit (which is usually a compilation task):

![Kotlin compiler options levels](compiler-options-levels.svg){width=700}

To learn more about the different levels and how compiler options can be configured between them, 
see [Compiler options](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#compiler-options).

### Preview Gradle's Isolated Projects in Kotlin Multiplatform

> This feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained) and is currently in a pre-Alpha state in Gradle.
> Use it only with Gradle version 8.10 and solely for evaluation purposes. The feature may be dropped or changed at any time.
> 
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-57279/Support-Gradle-Project-Isolation-Feature-for-Kotlin-Multiplatform). 
> Opt-in is required (see details below).
>
{style="warning"}

In Kotlin 2.1.0, 
you can preview Gradle's [Isolated Projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/isolated_projects.html) 
feature in your multiplatform projects.

The Isolated Projects feature in Gradle improves build performance by "isolating"
configuration of individual Gradle projects from each other.
Each project's build logic is restricted from directly accessing the mutable state of other projects,
allowing them to safely run in parallel.
To support this feature, we made some changes to the Kotlin Gradle plugin's model,
and we are interested in hearing about your experiences during this preview phase.

There are two ways to enable the Kotlin Gradle plugin's new model:

* Option 1: **Testing compatibility without enabling Isolated Projects** –
  To check compatibility with the Kotlin Gradle plugin's new model without enabling the Isolated Projects feature,
  add the following Gradle property in the `gradle.properties` file of your project:

  ```none
  # gradle.properties
  kotlin.kmp.isolated-projects.support=enable
  ```

* Option 2: **Testing with Isolated Projects enabled** –
  Enabling the Isolated Projects feature in Gradle automatically configures the Kotlin Gradle plugin to use the new model.
  To enable the Isolated Projects feature, [set the system property](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/isolated_projects.html#how_do_i_use_it).
  In this case, you don't need to add the Gradle property for the Kotlin Gradle plugin to your project.

Version 2.1.0 takes the first step towards providing support for Swift export in Kotlin,
allowing you to export Kotlin sources directly to the Swift interface without using Objective-C headers.
This should make multiplatform development for Apple targets easier.

The current basic support includes the ability to:

* Export multiple Gradle modules from Kotlin directly to Swift.
* Define custom Swift module names with the `moduleName` property.
* Set collapse rules for the package structure with the `flattenPackage` property.

You can use the following build file in your project as a starting point for setting up Swift export:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts 
kotlin {

    iosX64()
    iosArm64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()

    @OptIn(ExperimentalSwiftExportDsl::class)
    swiftExport {
        // Root module name
        moduleName = "Shared"

        // Collapse rule
        // Removes package prefix from generated Swift code
        flattenPackage = "com.example.sandbox"

        // Export external modules
        export(project(":subproject")) {
            // Exported module name
            moduleName = "Subproject"
            // Collapse exported dependency rule
            flattenPackage = "com.subproject.library"
        }
    }
}
```

You can also clone our [public sample](https://github.com/Kotlin/swift-export-sample) with Swift export already set up.

The compiler automatically generates all the necessary files (including `swiftmodule` files, 
static `a` library, and header and `modulemap` files) and copies them into the app's build directory,
which you can access from Xcode.

#### How to enable Swift export

Keep in mind that the feature is currently only in the early stages of development.

Swift export currently works in projects that use
[direct integration](multiplatform-direct-integration.md) to connect the iOS framework to the Xcode project.
This is a standard configuration for Kotlin Multiplatform projects created in Android Studio or through the [web wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com/).

To try out Swift export in your project:

1. Add the following Gradle option to your `gradle.properties` file:

   ```none
   # gradle.properties
   kotlin.experimental.swift-export.enabled=true
   ```

2. In Xcode, open the project settings.
3. On the **Build Phases** tab, locate the **Run Script** phase with the `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` task.
4. Adjust the script to feature the `embedSwiftExportForXcode` task instead in the run script phase:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :<Shared module name>:embedSwiftExportForXcode
   ```

   ![Add the Swift export script](xcode-swift-export-run-script-phase.png){width=700}

#### Leave feedback on Swift export

We're planning to expand and stabilize Swift export support in future Kotlin releases.
Please leave your feedback in [this YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-64572).

### Ability to publish Kotlin libraries from any host

The Kotlin compiler produces `.klib` artifacts for publishing Kotlin libraries.
Previously, you could get the necessary artifacts from any host, except for Apple platform targets that required a Mac machine. 
That put a special restraint on Kotlin Multiplatform projects that targeted iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS targets.

Kotlin 2.1.0 lifts this restriction, adding support for cross-compilation.
Now you can use any host to produce `.klib` artifacts,
which should greatly simplify the publishing process for Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform libraries.

#### How to enable publishing libraries from any host

To try cross-compilation out in your project, add the following binary option to your `gradle.properties` file:

```none
# gradle.properties
kotlin.native.enableKlibsCrossCompilation=true
```

This feature is currently Experimental and has some limitations. You still need to use a Mac machine if:

* Your library has a [cinterop dependency](native-c-interop.md).
* You have [CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md) set up in your project.
* You need to build or test [final binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md) for Apple targets.

#### Leave feedback on publishing libraries from any host

We're planning to stabilize this feature and further improve library publication in future Kotlin releases.
Please leave your feedback in our issue tracker [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71290).

For more information, see [Publishing multiplatform libraries](multiplatform-publish-lib.md).

### Support for non-packed klibs

Kotlin 2.1.0 makes it possible to generate non-packed `.klib` file artifacts.
This gives you the option to configure dependencies on klibs directly rather than unpack them first.

This change can also improve performance,
decreasing compilation and linking time in your Kotlin/Wasm, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/Native projects.

For example,
our benchmark shows a performance improvement of roughly 3% in total build time on the project with 1 linking and 10 compilation tasks
(the project builds a single native executable binary that depends on 9 simplified projects).
However, the actual impact on build time depends on both the number of subprojects and their respective sizes.

#### How to set up your project

By default, Kotlin compilation and linking tasks are now configured to use the new non-packed artifacts.

If you have set up custom build logic for resolving klibs and want to use the new unpacked artifacts,
you need to explicitly specify the preferred variant of klib package resolution in your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.attributes.KlibPackaging
// ...
val resolvableConfiguration = configurations.resolvable("resolvable") {

    // For the new non-packed configuration:
    attributes.attribute(KlibPackaging.ATTRIBUTE, project.objects.named(KlibPackaging.NON_PACKED))

    // For the previous packed configuration:
    attributes.attribute(KlibPackaging.ATTRIBUTE, project.objects.named(KlibPackaging.PACKED))
}
```

Non-packed `.klib` files are generated at the same path in your project's build directory as the packed ones previously were.
In turn, packed klibs are now located in the `build/libs` directory.

If no attribute is specified, the packed variant is used.
You can check the list of available attributes and variants with the following console command:

```shell
./gradlew outgoingVariants
```

We would appreciate your feedback on this feature in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

### Further deprecation of old `android` target

In Kotlin 2.1.0, the deprecation warning for the old `android` target name has been raised to an error.

Currently, we recommend using the `androidTarget` option in your Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Android.
This is a temporary solution that is necessary to free the `android` name for the upcoming Android/KMP plugin from Google.

We'll provide further migration instructions when the new plugin is available.
The new DSL from Google will be the preferred option for Android target support in Kotlin Multiplatform.

For more information,
see the [Kotlin Multiplatform compatibility guide](multiplatform-compatibility-guide.md#rename-of-android-target-to-androidtarget).

### Dropped support for declaring multiple targets of the same type

Before Kotlin 2.1.0, you could declare multiple targets of the same type in your multiplatform projects.
However, this made it challenging to distinguish between targets and to support shared source sets effectively.
In most cases, a simpler setup, such as using separate Gradle projects, works better.
For detailed guidance and an example of how to migrate,
see [Declaring several similar targets](multiplatform-compatibility-guide.md#declaring-several-similar-targets)
in the Kotlin Multiplatform compatibility guide.

Kotlin 1.9.20 triggered a deprecation warning if you declared multiple targets of the same type in your multiplatform projects.
In Kotlin 2.1.0, this deprecation warning is now an error for all targets except Kotlin/JS ones.
To learn more about why Kotlin/JS targets are exempt,
see this issue in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-47038/KJS-MPP-Split-JS-target-into-JsBrowser-and-JsNode).

## Kotlin/Native

Kotlin 2.1.0 includes an [upgrade for the `iosArm64` target support](#iosarm64-promoted-to-tier-1),
[improved cinterop caching process](#changes-to-caching-in-cinterop), and other updates.

### iosArm64 promoted to Tier 1

The `iosArm64` target, which is crucial for [Kotlin Multiplatform](multiplatform-intro.md) development,
has been promoted to Tier 1. This is the highest level of support in the Kotlin/Native compiler.

This means the target is regularly tested on the CI pipeline to ensure that it's able to compile and run.
We also provide source and binary compatibility between compiler releases for the target.

For more information on target tiers, see [Kotlin/Native target support](native-target-support.md).

### LLVM update from 11.1.0 to 16.0.0

In Kotlin 2.1.0, we updated LLVM from version 11.1.0 to 16.0.0.
The new version includes bug fixes and security updates.
In certain cases, it also provides compiler optimizations and faster compilation.

If you have Linux targets in your project,
take note that the Kotlin/Native compiler now uses the `lld` linker by default for all Linux targets.

This update shouldn't affect your code, but if you encounter any issues, please report them to our [issue tracker](http://kotl.in/issue).

### Changes to caching in cinterop

In Kotlin 2.1.0, we're making changes to the cinterop caching process. It no longer has the
[`CacheableTask`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/CacheableTask.html) annotation type.
The new recommended approach is to use the [`cacheIf`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/kotlin-dsl/gradle/org.gradle.api.tasks/-task-outputs/cache-if.html)
output type to cache the results of the task.

This should resolve issues where `UP-TO-DATE`
checks failed to detect changes to header files specified in the [definition file](native-definition-file.md),
preventing the build system from recompiling the code.

### Deprecation of the mimalloc memory allocator

Back in Kotlin 1.9.0, we introduced the new memory allocator, and then we enabled it by default in Kotlin 1.9.20.
The new allocator has been designed to make garbage collection more efficient
and improve the Kotlin/Native memory manager's runtime performance.

The new memory allocator replaced the previous default allocator, [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc).
Now, it's time to deprecate mimalloc in the Kotlin/Native compiler.

You can now remove the `-Xallocator=mimalloc` compiler option from your build scripts.
If you encounter any issues, please report them to our [issue tracker](http://kotl.in/issue).

For more information on the memory allocator and garbage collection in Kotlin,
see [Kotlin/Native memory management](native-memory-manager.md).

## Kotlin/Wasm

Kotlin/Wasm received multiple updates along with [support for incremental compilation](#support-for-incremental-compilation).

### Support for incremental compilation

Previously, when you changed something in your Kotlin code, the Kotlin/Wasm toolchain had to recompile the entire codebase.

Starting from 2.1.0, incremental compilation is supported for Wasm targets.
In development tasks, the compiler now recompiles only files relevant to changes from the last compilation,
which noticeably reduces the compilation time.

This change currently doubles the compilation speed, and there are plans to improve it further in future releases.

In the current setup, incremental compilation for Wasm targets is disabled by default.
To enable incremental compilation, add the following line to your project's `local.properties` or `gradle.properties` file:

```none
# gradle.properties
kotlin.incremental.wasm=true
```

Try out Kotlin/Wasm incremental compilation
and [share your feedback](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-72158/Kotlin-Wasm-incremental-compilation-feedback).
Your insights will help make this feature Stable and enabled by default sooner.

### Browser APIs moved to the kotlinx-browser stand-alone library

Previously, the declarations for web APIs and related target utilities were part of the Kotlin/Wasm standard library.

In this release, the `org.w3c.*`
declarations have been moved from the Kotlin/Wasm standard library to the new [kotlinx-browser library](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx-browser).
This library also includes other web-related packages, such as `org.khronos.webgl`, `kotlin.dom`, and `kotlinx.browser`.

This separation provides modularity, enabling independent updates for web-related APIs outside of Kotlin's release cycle.
Additionally, the Kotlin/Wasm standard library now contains only declarations available in any JavaScript environment.

To use the declarations from the moved packages,
you need to add the `kotlinx-browser` dependency to your project's build configuration file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
val wasmJsMain by getting {
    dependencies {
        implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-browser:0.3")
    }
}
```

### Improved debugging experience for Kotlin/Wasm

Previously, when debugging Kotlin/Wasm code in web browsers, you might have encountered
a low-level representation of variable values in the debugging interface.
This often made it challenging to track the current state of the application.

![Kotlin/Wasm old debugger](wasm-old-debugger.png){width=700}

To improve this experience, custom formatters have been added in the variable view.
The implementation uses the [custom formatters API](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/custom_formatters/index.html),
which is supported across major browsers like Firefox and Chromium-based ones.

With this change, you can now display and locate variable values in a more user-friendly and comprehensible manner.

![Kotlin/Wasm improved debugger](wasm-debugger-improved.png){width=700}

To try the new debugging experience:

1. Add the following compiler option to the `wasmJs {}` compiler options:

   ```kotlin
   // build.gradle.kts
   kotlin {
       wasmJs {
           // ...
   
           compilerOptions {
               freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwasm-debugger-custom-formatters")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Enable custom formatters in your browser:

   * In Chrome DevTools, it's available via **Settings | Preferences | Console**:

     ![Enable custom formatters in Chrome](wasm-custom-formatters-chrome.png){width=700}

   * In Firefox DevTools, it's available via **Settings | Advanced settings**:

     ![Enable custom formatters in Firefox](wasm-custom-formatters-firefox.png){width=700}

### Reduced size of Kotlin/Wasm binaries

The size of your Wasm binaries produced by production builds will be reduced by up to 30%,
and you may see some performance improvements.
This is because the `--closed-world`, `--type-ssa`, and `--type-merging`
Binaryen options are now considered safe to use for all Kotlin/Wasm projects and are enabled by default.

### Improved JavaScript array interoperability in Kotlin/Wasm

While Kotlin/Wasm's standard library provides the `JsArray<T>` type for JavaScript arrays,
there was no direct method to transform `JsArray<T>` into Kotlin's native `Array` or `List` types.

This gap required creating custom functions for array transformations, complicating interoperability between Kotlin and JavaScript code.

This release introduces an adapter function that automatically converts `JsArray<T>` to `Array<T>` and vice versa,
simplifying array operations.

Here's an example of conversion between generic types: Kotlin `List<T> `and `Array<T>` to JavaScript `JsArray<T>.`

```kotlin
val list: List<JsString> =
    listOf("Kotlin", "Wasm").map { it.toJsString() }

// Uses .toJsArray() to convert List or Array to JsArray
val jsArray: JsArray<JsString> = list.toJsArray()

// Uses .toArray() and .toList() to convert it back to Kotlin types 
val kotlinArray: Array<JsString> = jsArray.toArray()
val kotlinList: List<JsString> = jsArray.toList()
```

Similar methods are available for converting typed arrays to their Kotlin equivalents
(for example, `IntArray` and `Int32Array`). For detailed information and implementation,
see the [`kotlinx-browser` repository]( https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-browser/blob/dfbdceed314567983c98f1d66e8c2e10d99c5a55/src/wasmJsMain/kotlin/arrayCopy.kt).

Here's an example of conversion between typed arrays: Kotlin `IntArray` to JavaScript `Int32Array`.

```kotlin
import org.khronos.webgl.*

    // ...

    val intArray: IntArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3)
    
    // Uses .toInt32Array() to convert Kotlin IntArray to JavaScript Int32Array
    val jsInt32Array: Int32Array = intArray.toInt32Array()
    
    // Uses toIntArray() to convert JavaScript Int32Array back to Kotlin IntArray
    val kotlinIntArray: IntArray = jsInt32Array.toIntArray()
```

### Support for accessing JavaScript exception details in Kotlin/Wasm

Previously, when a JavaScript exception occurred in Kotlin/Wasm, 
the `JsException` type provided only a generic message without details from the original JavaScript error.

Starting from Kotlin 2.1.0, you can configure `JsException`
to include the original error message and stack trace by enabling a specific compiler option.
This provides more context to help diagnose issues originating from JavaScript.

This behavior depends on the `WebAssembly.JSTag` API, which is available only in certain browsers:

* **Chrome**: Supported from version 115
* **Firefox**: Supported from version 129
* **Safari**: Not yet supported

To enable this feature, which is disabled by default, 
add the following compiler option to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    wasmJs {
        compilerOptions {
            freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xwasm-attach-js-exception")
        }
    }
}
```

Here's an example demonstrating the new behavior:

```kotlin
external object JSON {
    fun <T: JsAny> parse(json: String): T
}

fun main() {
    try {
        JSON.parse("an invalid JSON")
    } catch (e: JsException) {
        println("Thrown value is: ${e.thrownValue}")
        // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'a', "an invalid JSON" is not valid JSON

        println("Message: ${e.message}")
        // Message: Unexpected token 'a', "an invalid JSON" is not valid JSON

        println("Stacktrace:")
        // Stacktrace:

        // Prints the full JavaScript stack trace 
        e.printStackTrace()
    }
}
```

With the `-Xwasm-attach-js-exception` option enabled, `JsException` provides specific details from the JavaScript error.
Without the option, `JsException` includes only a generic message stating that an exception was thrown while running JavaScript code.

### Deprecation of default exports

As part of the migration to named exports,
an error was previously printed to the console when a default import was used for Kotlin/Wasm exports in JavaScript.

In 2.1.0, default imports have been completely removed to fully support named exports.

When coding in JavaScript for the Kotlin/Wasm target, you now need to use the corresponding named imports instead of default imports.

This change marks the last phase of a deprecation cycle to migrate to named exports:

**In version 2.0.0:** A warning message was printed to the console, explaining that exporting entities via default exports is deprecated.

**In version 2.0.20:** An error occurred, requesting the use of the corresponding named import.

**In version 2.1.0:** The use of default imports has been completely removed.

### Subproject-specific Node.js settings

You can configure Node.js settings for your project by defining properties of the `NodeJsRootPlugin` class for `rootProject`.
In 2.1.0, you can configure these settings for each subproject using a new class, `NodeJsPlugin`.
Here's an example demonstrating how to set a specific Node.js version for a subproject:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
project.plugins.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.targets.js.nodejs.NodeJsPlugin> {
    project.the<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.targets.js.nodejs.NodeJsEnvSpec>().version = "22.0.0"
}
```

To use the new class for the entire project, add the same code in the `allprojects {}` block:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allprojects {
    project.plugins.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.targets.js.nodejs.NodeJsPlugin> {
        project.the<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.targets.js.nodejs.NodeJsEnvSpec>().version = "your Node.js version"
    }
}
```

You can also use Gradle convention plugins to apply the settings to a particular set of subprojects.

## Kotlin/JS

### Support for non-identifier characters in properties

Kotlin/JS previously did not allow using [names for test methods](coding-conventions.md#names-for-test-methods) with spaces enclosed in backticks.

Similarly, it was not possible to access JavaScript object properties that contained characters not permitted in Kotlin identifiers,
such as hyphens or spaces:

```kotlin
external interface Headers {
    var accept: String?

    // Invalid Kotlin identifier due to hyphen
    var `content-length`: String?
}

val headers: Headers = TODO("value provided by a JS library")
val accept = headers.accept
// Causes error due to the hyphen in property name
val length = headers.`content-length`
```

This behavior differed from JavaScript and TypeScript, which allow such properties to be accessed using non-identifier characters.

Starting from Kotlin 2.1.0, this feature is enabled by default.
Kotlin/JS now allows you to use the backticks (``) and the `@JsName` annotation
to interact with JavaScript properties containing non-identifier characters and to use names for test methods.

Additionally,
you can use the `@JsName` and ` @JsQualifier` annotations to map Kotlin property names to JavaScript equivalents:

```kotlin
object Bar {
    val `property example`: String = "bar"
}

@JsQualifier("fooNamespace")
external object Foo {
    val `property example`: String
}

@JsExport
object Baz {
    val `property example`: String = "bar"
}

fun main() {
    // In JavaScript, this is compiled into Bar.property_example_HASH
    println(Bar.`property example`)
    // In JavaScript, this is compiled into fooNamespace["property example"]
    println(Foo.`property example`)
    // In JavaScript, this is compiled into Baz["property example"]
    println(Baz.`property example`)
}
```

### Support for generating ES2015 arrow functions

In Kotlin 2.1.0, Kotlin/JS introduces support for generating ES2015 arrow functions,
such as `(a, b) => expression`, instead of anonymous functions.

Using arrow functions can reduce the bundle size of your project,
especially when using the experimental `-Xir-generate-inline-anonymous-functions` mode.
This also makes the generated code more aligned with modern JS.

This feature is enabled by default when targeting ES2015.
Alternatively, you can enable it by using the `-Xes-arrow-functions` command line argument.

Learn more about [ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015, ES6) in the official documentation](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/).

## Gradle improvements

Kotlin 2.1.0 is fully compatible with Gradle 7.6.3 through 8.6.
Gradle versions 8.7 to 8.10 are also supported, with only one exception.
If you use the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin,
you may see deprecation warnings in your multiplatform projects calling the [`withJava()` function in the JVM target](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#jvm-targets).
We plan to fix this issue as soon as possible.

For more information,
see the related issue in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-66542).

You can also use Gradle versions up to the latest Gradle release,
but if you do, keep in mind that you might encounter deprecation warnings or some new Gradle features might not work.

### Minimum supported AGP version bumped to 7.3.1

Starting with Kotlin 2.1.0, the minimum supported Android Gradle plugin version is 7.3.1.

### Minimum supported Gradle version bumped to 7.6.3

Starting with Kotlin 2.1.0, the minimum supported Gradle version is 7.6.3.

### New API for Kotlin Gradle plugin extensions

Kotlin 2.1.0 introduces a new API to make it easier to create your own plugins for configuring the Kotlin Gradle plugin.
This change deprecates the `KotlinTopLevelExtension` and `KotlinTopLevelExtensionConfig`
interfaces and introduces the following interfaces for plugin authors:

| Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KotlinBaseExtension`    | A plugin DSL extension type for configuring common Kotlin JVM, Android, and Multiplatform plugin options for the entire project:<list><li>`org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm`</li><li>`org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`</li><li>`org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform`</li></list> |
| `KotlinJvmExtension`     | A plugin DSL extension type for configuring Kotlin **JVM** plugin options for the entire project.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `KotlinAndroidExtension` | A plugin DSL extension type for configuring Kotlin **Android** plugin options for the entire project.                                                                                                                                                                |

For example, if you want to configure compiler options for both JVM and Android projects, use `KotlinBaseExtension`:

```kotlin
configure<KotlinBaseExtension> {
    if (this is HasConfigurableKotlinCompilerOptions<*>) {
        with(compilerOptions) {
            if (this is KotlinJvmCompilerOptions) {
                jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This configures the JVM target to 17 for both JVM and Android projects.

To configure compiler options specifically for JVM projects, use `KotlinJvmExtension`:

```kotlin
configure<KotlinJvmExtension> {
    compilerOptions {
        jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17)
    }

    target.mavenPublication {
        groupId = "com.example"
        artifactId = "example-project"
        version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    }
}
```

This example similarly configures the JVM target to 17 for JVM projects.
It also configures a Maven publication for the project so that its output is published to a Maven repository.

You can use the `KotlinAndroidExtension` in exactly the same way.

### Compiler symbols hidden from the Kotlin Gradle plugin API

Previously, KGP included `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` in its runtime dependencies,
making internal compiler symbols available in the build script classpath.
These symbols were intended for internal use only.

Starting with Kotlin 2.1.0, KGP bundles a subset of `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` class files in its JAR file and progressively removes them.
This change aims to prevent compatibility issues and simplify KGP maintenance.

If other parts of your build logic, such as plugins like `kotlinter`, depend on a different version of `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable`
than the one bundled with KGP, it can lead to conflicts and runtime exceptions.

To prevent such issues, KGP now shows a warning if `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` is present in the build classpath alongside KGP.

As a long-term solution, if you're a plugin author using `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` classes, we recommend running them in an isolated classloader.
For example, you can achieve it using the [Gradle Workers API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/worker_api.html) with classloader or process isolation.

#### Using the Gradle Workers API

This example demonstrates how to safely use the Kotlin compiler in a project producing a Gradle plugin.
First, add a compile-only dependency in your build script.
This makes the symbol available at compile time only:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    compileOnly("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable:%kotlinVersion%")
}
```

Next, define a Gradle work action to print the Kotlin compiler version:

```kotlin
import org.gradle.workers.WorkAction
import org.gradle.workers.WorkParameters
import org.jetbrains.kotlin.config.KotlinCompilerVersion
abstract class ActionUsingKotlinCompiler : WorkAction<WorkParameters.None> {
    override fun execute() {
        println("Kotlin compiler version: ${KotlinCompilerVersion.getVersion()}")
    }
}
```

Now create a task that submits this action to the worker executor using classloader isolation:

```kotlin
import org.gradle.api.DefaultTask
import org.gradle.api.file.ConfigurableFileCollection
import org.gradle.api.tasks.Classpath
import org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskAction
import org.gradle.workers.WorkerExecutor
import javax.inject.Inject
abstract class TaskUsingKotlinCompiler: DefaultTask() {
    @get:Inject
    abstract val executor: WorkerExecutor

    @get:Classpath
    abstract val kotlinCompiler: ConfigurableFileCollection

    @TaskAction
    fun compile() {
        val workQueue = executor.classLoaderIsolation {
            classpath.from(kotlinCompiler)
        }
        workQueue.submit(ActionUsingKotlinCompiler::class.java) {}
    }
}
```

Finally, configure the Kotlin compiler classpath in your Gradle plugin:

```kotlin
import org.gradle.api.Plugin
import org.gradle.api.Project
abstract class MyPlugin: Plugin<Project> {
    override fun apply(target: Project) {
        val myDependencyScope = target.configurations.create("myDependencyScope")
        target.dependencies.add(myDependencyScope.name, "$KOTLIN_COMPILER_EMBEDDABLE:$KOTLIN_COMPILER_VERSION")
        val myResolvableConfiguration = target.configurations.create("myResolvable") {
            extendsFrom(myDependencyScope)
        }
        target.tasks.register("myTask", TaskUsingKotlinCompiler::class.java) {
            kotlinCompiler.from(myResolvableConfiguration)
        }
    }

    companion object {
        const val KOTLIN_COMPILER_EMBEDDABLE = "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler-embeddable"
        const val KOTLIN_COMPILER_VERSION = "%kotlinVersion%"
    }
}
```

## Compose compiler updates

### Support for multiple stability configuration files

The Compose compiler can interpret multiple stability configuration files,
but the `stabilityConfigurationFile` option of the Compose Compiler Gradle plugin previously allowed
for only a single file to be specified.
In Kotlin 2.1.0, this functionality was reworked to allow you to use several stability configuration files for a single module:

* The `stabilityConfigurationFile` option is deprecated.
* There is a new option, `stabilityConfigurationFiles`, with the type `ListProperty<RegularFile>`.

Here's how to pass several files to the Compose compiler using the new option:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kt
composeCompiler {
    stabilityConfigurationFiles.addAll(
        project.layout.projectDirectory.file("configuration-file1.conf"),
        project.layout.projectDirectory.file("configuration-file2.conf"),
    )
}
```

### Pausable composition

Pausable composition is a new Experimental feature that changes how the compiler generates skippable functions. 
With this feature enabled, composition can be suspended on skipping points during runtime,
allowing long-running composition processes to be split across multiple frames.
Pausable composition is used in lazy lists and other performance-intensive components for prefetching content
that might cause frames to drop when executed in a blocking manner.

To try out pausable composition, add the following feature flag in the Gradle configuration for the Compose compiler:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
composeCompiler {
    featureFlags = setOf(
        ComposeFeatureFlag.PausableComposition
    )
}
```

> Runtime support for this feature was added in the 1.8.0-alpha02 version of `androidx.compose.runtime`.
> The feature flag has no effect when used with older runtime versions.
>
{style="note"}

### Changes to open and overridden @Composable functions

Virtual (open, abstract, and overridden) `@Composable` functions can no longer be restartable.
The codegen for restartable groups was generating calls that [did not work correctly](https://issuetracker.google.com/329477544)
with inheritance, resulting in runtime crashes.

This means that virtual functions won't be restarted or skipped:
whenever their state is invalidated, runtime will recompose their parent composable instead.
If your code is sensitive to recompositions, you may notice changes in runtime behavior.

### Performance improvements

The Compose compiler used to create a full copy of module's IR to transform `@Composable` types.
Apart from increased memory consumption when copying elements that were not related to Compose,
this behavior was also breaking downstream compiler plugins in [certain edge cases](https://issuetracker.google.com/365066530).

This copy operation was removed, resulting in potentially faster compilation times.

## Standard library

### Changes to the deprecation severity of standard library APIs

In Kotlin 2.1.0, we are raising the deprecation severity level of several standard library APIs from warning to error.
If your code relies on these APIs, you need to update it to ensure compatibility.
The most notable changes include:

* **Locale-sensitive case conversion functions for `Char` and `String` are deprecated:**
  Functions like `Char.toLowerCase()`, `Char.toUpperCase()`, `String.toUpperCase()`,
  and `String.toLowerCase()` are now deprecated, and using them results in an error.
  Replace them with locale-agnostic function alternatives or other case conversion mechanisms.
  If you want to continue using the default locale, replace calls like `String.toLowerCase()`
  with `String.lowercase(Locale.getDefault())`, explicitly specifying the locale.
  For a locale-agnostic conversion, replace them with `String.lowercase()`, which uses the invariant locale by default.

* **Kotlin/Native freezing API is deprecated:**
  Using the freezing-related declarations previously marked with the `@FreezingIsDeprecated` annotation now results in an error.
  This change reflects the transition from the legacy memory manager in Kotlin/Native,
  which required freezing objects to share them between threads.
  To learn how to migrate from freezing-related APIs in the new memory model,
  see the [Kotlin/Native migration guide](native-migration-guide.md#update-your-code).
  For more information, see the [announcement about the deprecation of freezing](whatsnew1720.md#freezing).

* **`appendln()` is deprecated in favor of `appendLine()`:**
  The `StringBuilder.appendln()` and `Appendable.appendln()` functions are now deprecated, and using them results in an error.
  To replace them, use the `StringBuilder.appendLine()` or `Appendable.appendLine()` functions instead.
  The `appendln()` function is deprecated because, on Kotlin/JVM, it uses the `line.separator` system property,
  which has a different default value on each OS. On Kotlin/JVM, this property defaults to `\r\n` (CR LF) on Windows and `\n` (LF) on other systems.
  On the other hand, the `appendLine()` function consistently uses `\n` (LF) as the line separator, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

For a complete list of affected APIs in this release, see the [KT-71628](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-71628) YouTrack issue.

### Stable file tree traversal extensions for java.nio.file.Path

Kotlin 1.7.20 introduced Experimental [extension functions](extensions.md#extension-functions) for the `java.nio.file.Path` class,
which allows you to walk through a file tree.
In Kotlin 2.1.0, the following file tree traversal extensions are now [Stable](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained):

* `walk()` lazily traverses the file tree rooted at the specified path.
* `fileVisitor()` makes it possible to create a `FileVisitor` separately. 
  `FileVisitor` specifies the actions to be performed on directories and files during traversal.
* `visitFileTree(fileVisitor: FileVisitor, ...)` traverses through a file tree,
  invoking the specified `FileVisitor` on each encountered entry, and it uses the `java.nio.file.Files.walkFileTree()` function under the hood.
* `visitFileTree(..., builderAction: FileVisitorBuilder.() -> Unit)` creates a `FileVisitor` with the provided `builderAction`
  and calls the `visitFileTree(fileVisitor, ...)` function.
* `sealed interface FileVisitorBuilder` allows you to define a custom `FileVisitor` implementation.
* `enum class PathWalkOption` provides traversal options for the `Path.walk()` function.

The examples below demonstrate how to use these file traversal APIs to create custom `FileVisitor` behaviors,
which allows you to define specific actions for visiting files and directories.

For instance, you can explicitly create a `FileVisitor` and use it later:

```kotlin
val cleanVisitor = fileVisitor {
    onPreVisitDirectory { directory, attributes ->
        // Placeholder: Add logic on visiting directories
        FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
    }

    onVisitFile { file, attributes ->
        // Placeholder: Add logic on visiting files
        FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
    }
}

// Placeholder: Add logic here for general setup before traversal
projectDirectory.visitFileTree(cleanVisitor)
```

You can also create a `FileVisitor` with the `builderAction` and use it immediately for the traversal:

```kotlin
projectDirectory.visitFileTree {
    // Defines the builderAction:
    onPreVisitDirectory { directory, attributes ->
        // Some logic on visiting directories
        FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
    }

    onVisitFile { file, attributes ->
        // Some logic on visiting files
        FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
    }
}
```

Additionally, you can traverse a file tree rooted at the specified path with the `walk()` function:

```kotlin
fun traverseFileTree() {
    val cleanVisitor = fileVisitor {
        onPreVisitDirectory { directory, _ ->
            if (directory.name == "build") {
                directory.toFile().deleteRecursively()
                FileVisitResult.SKIP_SUBTREE
            } else {
                FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
            }
        }

        // Deletes files with the .class extension
        onVisitFile { file, _ ->
            if (file.extension == "class") {
                file.deleteExisting()
            }
            FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
        }
    }

    // Sets up the root directory and files
    val rootDirectory = createTempDirectory("Project")

    // Creates the src directory with A.kt and A.class files
    rootDirectory.resolve("src").let { srcDirectory ->
        srcDirectory.createDirectory()
        srcDirectory.resolve("A.kt").createFile()
        srcDirectory.resolve("A.class").createFile()
    }

    // Creates the build directory with a Project.jar file
    rootDirectory.resolve("build").let { buildDirectory ->
        buildDirectory.createDirectory()
        buildDirectory.resolve("Project.jar").createFile()
    }

    // Uses the walk() function:
    val directoryStructure = rootDirectory.walk(PathWalkOption.INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)
        .map { it.relativeTo(rootDirectory).toString() }
        .toList().sorted()
    println(directoryStructure)
    // "[, build, build/Project.jar, src, src/A.class, src/A.kt]"
  
    // Traverses the file tree with cleanVisitor, applying the rootDirectory.visitFileTree(cleanVisitor) cleanup rules
    val directoryStructureAfterClean = rootDirectory.walk(PathWalkOption.INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)
        .map { it.relativeTo(rootDirectory).toString() }
        .toList().sorted()
    println(directoryStructureAfterClean)
    // "[, src, src/A.kt]"
}
```
