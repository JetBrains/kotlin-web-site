## New approach to auto-generated targets

**What's changed?**

Target accessors auto-generated by Gradle are no longer available inside the `kotlin.targets` block. Use
the `findByName("targetName")` method instead.

Note that such accessors are still available in the `kotlin.targets` case, for example, `kotlin.targets.linuxX64`.

**What's the best practice now?**

<table header-style="top">
    <tr>
        <td>Before</td>
        <td>Now</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
kotlin {
    targets {
        configure(['windows',
            'linux']) {
        }
    }
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
kotlin {
    targets {
        configure([findByName('windows'),
            findByName('linux')]) {
        }
    }
}
```

</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.7.20, an error is introduced when using target accessors in the `kotlin.targets` block.

For more information, see the [corresponding issue in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-47047).

## Changes in Gradle input and output compile tasks

**What's changed?**

Kotlin compile tasks no longer inherit the Gradle `AbstractCompile` task that has the `sourceCompatibility` and
`targetCompatibility` inputs, making them unavailable in Kotlin users' scripts.

Other breaking changes in compile tasks:

**What's the best practice now?**

| Before                                                              | Now                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The `SourceTask.stableSources` input is no longer available.        | Use the `sources` input instead. Also, the `setSource()` methods are still available.                          |
| The `sourceFilesExtensions` input was removed.                      | Compile tasks still implement the `PatternFilterable` interface. Use its methods for filtering Kotlin sources. |
| The `Gradle destinationDir: File` output was deprecated.            | Use the `destinationDirectory: DirectoryProperty` output instead.                                              |
| The `classpath` property of the `KotlinCompile` task is deprecated. | All compile tasks now use the `libraries` input for a list of libraries required for compilation.              |

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.7.20, inputs are not available, the output is replaced, and the `classpath` property is deprecated.

For more information, see the [corresponding issue in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-32805).

## New configuration names for dependencies on the compilation

**What's changed?**

Compilation configurations created by the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle Plugin received new names.

A target in the Kotlin Multiplatform project has two default compilations, `main` and `test`. Each of these compilations
has its own default source set, for example, `jvmMain` and `jvmTest`. Previously the configuration names for the test
compilation and its default source set were the same, which might lead to a name clash resulting in issues when a
configuration marked with platform-specific attributes is included in another configuration.

Now compilation configurations have an extra `Compilation` postfix, while projects and plugins that use old hard-coded
configuration names no longer compile.

Configuration names for dependencies on the corresponding source set stay the same.

**What's the best practice now?**

<table header-style="top">
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Before</td>
        <td>Now</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Dependencies of the <code>jvmMain</code> compilation</td>
<td>

```kotlin
jvm<Scope>
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
jvmCompilation<Scope>
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
dependencies {
    add("jvmImplementation",
        "foo.bar.baz:1.2.3")
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
dependencies {
    add("jvmCompilationImplementation",
        "foo.bar.baz:1.2.3")
}
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmMain</code> source set</td>
<td colspan="2">

```kotlin
jvmMain<Scope>
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmTest</code> compilation</td>
<td>

```kotlin
jvmTest<Scope>
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
jvmTestCompilation<Scope>
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmTest</code> source set</td>
<td colspan="2">

```kotlin
jvmTest<Scope>
```

</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The available scopes are `Api`, `Implementation`, `CompileOnly`, and `RuntimeOnly`.

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.8.0, an error is introduced when using old configuration names in hard-coded strings.

For more information, see the [corresponding issue in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-35916/).

## Deprecated Gradle properties for hierarchical structure support

**What's changed?**

Throughout its evolution, Kotlin was gradually introducing the support for [hierarchical structure](multiplatform-hierarchy.md),
in multiplatform projects, an ability to have intermediate source sets between the common source set `commonMain` and
any platform-specific one, for example, `jvmMain`.

For the transition period, while the toolchain wasn't stable enough, a couple of Gradle properties were introduced,
allowing granular opt-ins and opt-outs.

Since Kotlin 1.6.20, the hierarchical project structure support has been enabled by default. However, these properties
were kept for opting out in case of blocking issues. After processing all the feedback, we're now starting to phase out
those properties completely.

The following properties are now deprecated:

* `kotlin.internal.mpp.hierarchicalStructureByDefault`
* `kotlin.mpp.enableCompatibilityMetadataVariant`
* `kotlin.mpp.hierarchicalStructureSupport`
* `kotlin.mpp.enableGranularSourceSetsMetadata`
* `kotlin.native.enableDependencyPropagation`

**What's the best practice now?**

* Remove these properties from your `gradle.properties` and `local.properties` files.
* Avoid setting them programmatically in the Gradle build scripts or your Gradle plugins.
* In case deprecated properties are set by some third-party Gradle plugin used in your build, ask the plugin maintainers
not to set these properties.

As the default behavior of the Kotlin toolchain doesn't include such properties since 1.6.20, we don't expect
any serious impact from removing them. Most possible consequences will be visible immediately after the project rebuild.

If you're a library author and want to be extra safe, check that consumers can work with your library.

**When do the changes take effect?**

* In 1.8.20, usage of these properties provokes a warning
* In 1.9.20, usage of these properties provokes an error
* In 2.0, support for these properties will be removed, and Kotlin Gradle Plugin will ignore them 

In the unlikely case you face some problems after removing these properties, create an [issue in YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

## Deprecated support of multiplatform libraries published in the legacy mode

**What's changed?**

Previously, we [have deprecated
the legacy mode](#deprecated-gradle-properties-for-hierarchical-structure-support) in Kotlin Multiplatform projects
preventing the publication of "legacy" binaries and encouraged you to migrate your projects to the [hierarchical structure](multiplatform-hierarchy.md).

To continue phasing out "legacy" binaries from the ecosystem, starting with Kotlin 1.9.0, the use of legacy libraries
is also discouraged. If your project uses dependencies on legacy libraries, you'll see the following warning:

```none
The dependency group:artifact:1.0 was published in the legacy mode. Support for such dependencies will be removed in the future
```

**What's the best practice now?**

_If you use multiplatform libraries_, most of them have already migrated to the "hierarchical structure" mode,
so you only need to update the library version. See the documentation of the respective libraries for details.

If the library doesn't support non-legacy binaries yet, you can contact the maintainers and tell them about this
compatibility issue.

_If you're a library author_, update the Kotlin Gradle plugin to the latest version and ensure you've fixed the [deprecated Gradle properties](#deprecated-gradle-properties-for-hierarchical-structure-support).

The Kotlin team is eager to help the ecosystem migrate, so if you face any issues, don't hesitate to create an [issue in YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

**When do the changes take effect?**

* 1.9.0: introduce a deprecation warning for dependencies on legacy libraries
* 1.9.20: raise the warning for dependencies on legacy libraries to an error
* \> 1.9.20: the support for dependencies on legacy libraries is removed. Using such dependencies can cause build failures

## Deprecated API for adding Kotlin source sets directly to the Kotlin compilation

**What's changed?**

The access to `KotlinCompilation.source` has been deprecated. A code like this produces a deprecation warning:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    jvm()
    js()
    ios()
    
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting 
        val myCustomIntermediateSourceSet by creating {
            dependsOn(commonMain)
        }
        
        targets["jvm"].compilations["main"].source(myCustomIntermediateSourceSet)
    }
}
```

**What's the best practice now?**

To replace `KotlinCompilation.source(someSourceSet)`, add the  `dependsOn` relation from the
default source set of the `KotlinCompilation` to `someSourceSet`. We recommend referring to the source directly using `by getting`,
which is shorter and more readable. However, you can also use `KotlinCompilation.defaultSourceSet.dependsOn(someSourceSet)`,
which is applicable in all cases.

You can change the code above in one of the following ways:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    jvm()
    js()
    ios()

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting
        val myCustomIntermediateSourceSet by creating {
            dependsOn(commonMain)
        }

        // Option #1. Shorter and more readable, use it when possible:
       val jvmMain by getting { // Usually, the name of the default source set 
                                // is a simple concatenation of the target name and the compilation name
            dependsOn(myCustomIntermediateSourceSet)
        }
        
        // Option #2. Generic solution, use it if your build script requires a more advanced approach:
        targets["jvm"].compilations["main"].defaultSourceSet.dependsOn(myCustomIntermediateSourceSet)
    }
}
```

**When do the changes take effect?**

* 1.9.0: the use of `KotlinComplation.source` produces a deprecation warning
* 1.9.20: the use of `KotlinComplation.source` produces a deprecation error
* \>1.9.20: `KotlinComplation.source` is removed from the Kotlin Gradle Plugin. Using it will lead to "unresolved 
reference"-errors during the buildscript compilation

## Migration from `kotlin-js` Gradle plugin to `kotlin-multiplatform` Gradle plugin

**What's changed?**

Starting with Kotlin 1.9.0, the `kotlin-js` Gradle plugin is
deprecated. Basically, it duplicated the functionality of the `kotlin-multiplatform` plugin with the `js()` target
and shared the same implementation under the hood. Such overlap created confusion and increased maintenance
load on the Kotlin team. We encourage you to migrate to the `kotlin-multiplatform` Gradle plugin with the `js()` target instead.

**What's the best practice now?**

1. Remove the `kotlin-js` Gradle plugin from your project and apply `kotlin-multiplatform` in the `settings.gradle.kts` file
   if you're using the `pluginManagement` block:

   <tabs>
   <tab title="kotlin-js">
   
   ```kotlin
   // settings.gradle.kts
   pluginManagement {
       plugins {
           // Remove the following line:
           kotlin("js") version "1.9.0"
       }
       
       repositories {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```
   
   </tab>
   <tab title="kotlin-multiplatform">
   
   ```kotlin
   // settings.gradle.kts
   pluginManagement {
       plugins {
           // Add the following line instead:
           kotlin("multiplatform") version "1.9.0"
       }
       
       repositories {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```
   
   </tab>
   </tabs>

   In case you're using a different way of applying plugins,
   see [the Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html) for migration instructions.

2. Move your source files from the `main` and `test` folders to the `jsMain` and `jsTest` folders in the same directory.
3. Adjust dependency declarations:

   * We recommend using the `sourceSets` block and configuring dependencies of respective source sets,
     `jsMain` for production dependencies and `jsTest` for test dependencies.
     See [Adding dependencies](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) for more details.
   * However, if you want to declare your dependencies in a top-level block,
     change declarations from `api("group:artifact:1.0")` to `add("jsMainApi", "group:artifact:1.0")` and so on.

      > In this case, make sure that the top-level `dependencies` block comes **after** the `kotlin` block. Otherwise, you'll get an error "Configuration not found".
      >
      {type="note"}
   
   You can change the code in your `build.gradle.kts` file in one of the following ways:

   <tabs>
   <tab title="kotlin-js">
   
   ```kotlin
   // build.gradle.kts
   plugins {
       kotlin("js") version "1.9.0"
   }
   
   dependencies {
       testImplementation(kotlin("test"))
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-html:0.8.0")
   }
   
   kotlin {
       js {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```
   
   </tab>
   <tab title="kotlin-multiplatform">
   
   ```kotlin
   // build.gradle.kts
   plugins {
       kotlin("multiplatform") version "1.9.0"
   }
   
   kotlin {
       js {
           // ...
       }
       
       // Option #1. Declare dependencies in the `sourceSets` block:
       sourceSets {
           val jsMain by getting {
               dependencies {
                   // No need for the `js` prefix here, you can just copy and paste it from the top-level block
                   implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-html:0.8.0")
               }
           }
       }
   }
   
   dependencies {
      // Option #2. Add the `js` prefix to the dependency declaration:
      add("jsTestImplementation", kotlin("test"))
   }
   ```
   
   </tab>
   </tabs>

4. The DSL provided by the Kotlin Gradle plugin inside the `kotlin` block remains unchanged in most cases. However,
   if you were referring to low-level Gradle entities, like tasks and configurations, by names, you now need to adjust them,
   usually by adding the `js` prefix. For example, you can find the `browserTest` task under the name `jsBrowserTest`.

**When do the changes take effect?**

In 1.9.0, the use of the `kotlin-js` Gradle plugin produces a deprecation warning.

<anchor name="android-target-rename"></anchor>
## Rename of `android` target to `androidTarget`

**What's changed?**

We continue our efforts to stabilize Kotlin Multiplatform. An essential step in this way is to provide first-class
support for the Android target. In the future, this support will be provided via a separate plugin, developed by the
Android team from Google.

To open the way for the new solution from Google, we're renaming the `android` block to `androidTarget` in the current
Kotlin DSL in 1.9.0. This is a temporary change that is necessary to free the short `android` name for the upcoming DSL
from Google.

**What's the best practice now?**

Rename all the occurrences of  the `android` block to `androidTarget`. When the new plugin for the Android target support
is available, migrate to the DSL from Google. It will be the preferred option to work with Android in Kotlin Multiplatform
projects.

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.9.0, a deprecation warning is introduced when the `android` name is used in Kotlin Multiplatform projects.

<anchor name="jvmWithJava-preset-deprecation"></anchor>
## Deprecation of 'jvmWithJava'-preset

**What's changed?**

`targetPresets.jvmWithJava` is deprecated and its usage is discouraged

**What's the best practice now?**

Use `jvm { withJava() }` target instead. Note that after switching to `jvm { withJava() }`, paths for source directories
with .java-sources will need an adjustment. Assuming you use a `jvm`-target with the default name "jvm":
* instead of `src/main/java`, use `src/jvmMain/java`
* instead of `src/test/java`, use `src/jvmTest/java`

**When do the changes take effect?**

* 1.3.40: using `targetPresets.jvmWithJava` provokes a warning
* 1.9.20: using `targetPresets.jvmWithJava` provokes an error
* \>1.9.20: `targetPresets.jvmWithJava` API is removed. Using it will cause the buildscript compilation failure  

> Note that the whole `targetPresets` API is deprecated, but `jvmWithJava`-preset has different deprecation timeline  
> 
>{type="note"}

<anchor name="android-sourceset-layout-v1-deprecation"></anchor>
## Deprecation of the legacy source set layout for Android

Since Kotlin 1.9.0, new layout for Android Source Sets is used (read details about source set layouts 
[here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-android-layout.html)). Support for the legacy layout is deprecated, 
and using respective Gradle property `kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion` will trigger deprecation diagnostic

**When do the changes take effect?**

* <=1.9.0: using `kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion=1` provokes a warning that can be suppressed via 
`kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion1.nowarn=true` Gradle Property

* 1.9.20: using `kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion=1` provokes an error. This error **can not** be suppressed by
`kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion1.nowarn=true`

* \>1.9.20: support for `kotlin.mpp.androidSourceSetLayoutVersion=1` is removed, the property is ignored by the 
Kotlin Gradle Plugin
