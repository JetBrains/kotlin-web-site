## New approach to auto-generated targets

**What's changed?**

Target accessors auto-generated by Gradle are no longer available inside the `kotlin.targets` block. Use
the `findByName("targetName")` method instead.

Note that such accessors are still available in the `kotlin.targets` case, for example, `kotlin.targets.linuxX64`.

**What's the best practice now?**

<table header-style="top">
    <tr>
        <td>Before</td>
        <td>Now</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td>

```kotlin
kotlin {
    targets {
        configure(['windows',
            'linux']) {
        }
    }
}
```

</td>
<td>

```kotlin
kotlin {
    targets {
        configure([findByName('windows'),
            findByName('linux')]) {
        }
    }
}
```

</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.7.20, an error is introduced when using target accessors in the `kotlin.targets` block.

## Changes in Gradle input and output compile tasks

**What's changed?**

Kotlin compile tasks no longer inherit the Gradle `AbstractCompile` task that has the `sourceCompatibility` and
`targetCompatibility` inputs, making them unavailable in Kotlin users' scripts.

Other breaking changes in compile tasks:

**What's the best practice now?**

| Before                                                              | Now                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The `SourceTask.stableSources` input is no longer available.        | Use the `sources` input instead. Also, the `setSource()` methods are still available.                          |
| The `sourceFilesExtensions` input was removed.                      | Compile tasks still implement the `PatternFilterable` interface. Use its methods for filtering Kotlin sources. |
| The `Gradle destinationDir: File` output was deprecated.            | Use the `destinationDirectory: DirectoryProperty` output instead.                                              |
| The `classpath` property of the `KotlinCompile` task is deprecated. | All compile tasks now use the `libraries` input for a list of libraries required for compilation.              |

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.7.20, inputs are not available, the output is replaced, and the `classpath` property is deprecated.

## New configuration names for dependencies on the compilation

**What's changed?**

Compilation configurations created by the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle Plugin received new names.

A target in the Kotlin Multiplatform project has two default compilations, `main` and `test`. Each of these compilations
has its own default source set, for example, `jvmMain` and `jvmTest`. Previously the configuration names for the test
compilation and its default source set were the same, which might lead to a name clash resulting in issues when a
configuration marked with platform-specific attributes is included in another configuration.

Now compilation configurations have an extra `Compilation` postfix, while projects and plugins that use old hard-coded
configuration names no longer compile.

Configuration names for dependencies on the corresponding source set stay the same.

    <tr>

```kotlin

```kotlin

    add("jvmCompilationImplementation",
        "foo.bar.baz:1.2.3")
}
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmMain</code> source set</td>
<td colspan="2">

```kotlin

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmTest</code> compilation</td>
<td>

```kotlin

```kotlin

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dependencies of the <code>jvmTest</code> source set</td>
<td colspan="2">

```kotlin
jvmTest<Scope>
```

</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The available scopes are `Api`, `Implementation`, `CompileOnly`, and `RuntimeOnly`.

**When do the changes take effect?**

In Kotlin 1.8.0, an error is introduced when using old configuration names in hard-coded strings.

## Deprecated Gradle properties for hierarchical structure support

**What's changed?**

Throughout its evolution, Kotlin was gradually introducing the support for [hierarchical structure](multiplatform-hierarchy.md),
in multiplatform projects, an ability to have intermediate source sets between the common source set `commonMain` and
any platform-specific one, for example, `jvmMain`.

For the transition period, while the toolchain wasn't stable enough, a couple of Gradle properties were introduced,
allowing granular opt-ins and opt-outs.

Since Kotlin 1.6.20, the hierarchical project structure support has been enabled by default. However, these properties
were kept for opting out in case of blocking issues. After processing all the feedback, we're now starting to phase out
those properties completely.

The following properties are now deprecated and will be removed in Kotlin 1.9.20:

* `kotlin.internal.mpp.hierarchicalStructureByDefault`
* `kotlin.mpp.enableCompatibilityMetadataVariant`
* `kotlin.mpp.hierarchicalStructureSupport`
* `kotlin.mpp.enableGranularSourceSetsMetadata`
* `kotlin.native.enableDependencyPropagation`

**What's the best practice now?**

* Remove these properties from your `gradle.properties` and `local.properties` files.
* Avoid setting them programmatically in the Gradle build scripts or your Gradle plugins.
* In case deprecated properties are set by some third-party Gradle plugin used in your build, ask the plugin maintainers
not to set these properties.

As the default behavior of the Kotlin toolchain doesn't include such properties since 1.6.20, we don't expect
any serious impact from removing them. Most possible consequences will be visible immediately after the project rebuild.

If you're a library author and want to be extra safe, check that consumers can work with your library.

**When do the changes take effect?**

In 1.8.20, the Kotlin Gradle plugin shows a warning if the build sets these properties. Starting with Kotlin 1.9.0,
the properties are silently ignored.

In the unlikely case you face some problems after removing these properties, create an [issue in YouTrack](https://kotlin.in/issue).
