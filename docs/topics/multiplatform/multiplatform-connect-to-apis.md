[//]: # (title: Connect to platform-specific APIs)

Some multiplatform applications can be written entirely in common code. Others have requirements that go beyond what
multiplatform libraries can provide.

In the second case, you need to work with the APIs of the underlying platform, such as Android or iOS. The Kotlin
language provides a mechanism of expected and actual declarations to enable this process.

You can use these declarations directly in your code. However, many projects are better off using the same functionality
indirectly using dependency injection (DI). Let's compare these approaches.

## Work with a DI framework

To create a loosely coupled architecture, many Kotlin projects adopt the dependency injection framework. The DI
framework allows injecting dependencies into components based on the current environment.

For example, you might inject different dependencies in QA and in production or when deployed to the cloud compared to
hosting locally. As long as the dependency is expressed through an interface, any number of different implementations
can be injected, either at compile time or runtime.

The same principle applies when the dependencies are platform-specific. In common code, a component can express its
dependencies using regular [Kotlin interfaces](interfaces.md). The DI framework can then be configured to inject a
platform-specific implementation, for example, from a JVM or an iOS module.

This means that the only case when expected and actual declarations are needed is in the configuration of the DI
framework. In the [Koin framework](https://insert-koin.io/), you can use DSLs to create modules that define components
for injection. It's possible to declare a module in common code with the `expect` keyword and then provide a
platform-specific implementation for each platform using the `actual` keyword. The framework takes care of selecting the
correct implementation at build time.

With this approach, you can adopt Kotlin Multiplatform simply by using interfaces and some object-oriented best
practices. The drawback is that you need to choose and work with a DI framework.<!-- For more details, see the Dependency
injection.-->

## Use expected and actual declarations directly

If you choose not to work with a DI framework, you can use expected and actual declarations directly. Follow these
steps:

1. In the common source set, declare a standard Kotlin construct. This could be a function, property, class, interface,
   enumeration, or annotation.
2. Mark this construct with the `expect` keyword. It's your _expected declaration_. These declarations can be used in
   common code but should not include implementation. Instead, the platform-specific code provides this implementation.
3. In each platform-specific source set, declare the same construct in the same package and mark it with the `actual`
   keyword. It's your _actual declaration_. Typically, it contains an implementation using platform-specific libraries.

![Expect/actual declarations in common and platform-specific modules](expect-actual.png){width=700}

While compiling a specific target, the compiler tries to match each actual declaration it finds with the corresponding
_expected_ declaration in common code. The compiler ensures that:

* Every expected declaration in the common module has a matching actual declaration in every platform-specific module.
* Expected declarations do not contain any implementation.
* Every actual declaration shares the same package as the corresponding expected declaration, such
  as `org.mygroup.myapp.MyType`.

The IDE provides assistance for common issues when declarations are missing, the expected declaration contains
implementation, the signatures of declarations do not match, or the declarations are in different packages.

You can also use the IDE to navigate from the expected to actual declarations. You can select the gutter icon to view
actual declarations or use [shortcuts](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html#go_to_implementation).

### A sample project

You can find a simple example of expected and actual declarations in the **Kotlin Multiplatform App** template in
Android Studio. The project wizard generates sample code that uses expected and actual declarations:

* In the `commonMain` source set, you'll find the following common code:

  ```kotlin
  class Greeting {
      private val platform: Platform = getPlatform()
  
      fun greet(): String {
          return "Hello, ${platform.name}!"
      }
  }
  
  interface Platform {
      val name: String
  }
  
  expect fun getPlatform(): Platform
  ```

The `Greeting` and `Platform` types belong to common code, but the `getPlatform()` function is an expected declaration.
So, it should be implemented on each supported platform.

* In the `androidMain` source set, you can find the following implementation for Android:

  ```kotlin
  class AndroidPlatform : Platform {
      override val name: String = "Android ${android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT}"
  }
  
  actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = AndroidPlatform()
  ```

* In the `iosMain` source set, you can find the following implementation for iOS:

  ```kotlin
  class IOSPlatform : Platform {
      override val name: String = UIDevice.currentDevice.systemName() + " " + UIDevice.currentDevice.systemVersion
  }
  
  actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = IOSPlatform()
  ```

Neither the `Platform` interface here nor the `AndroidPlatform` and `IOSPlatform` implementations are actual
declarations. The `getPlatform()` function is the only place where the compiler has to apply the special mechanism of
replacing the expected declaration with an actual one.

If you used a DI framework like Koin, you would instead configure the framework to provide the correct implementation.

### Some more examples

For simplicity, the following examples use intuitive target names, like iOS and Android. However, in your Gradle build files,
you need to use a specific target name from [the list of supported targets](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#targets).

#### Generate a UUID {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Let's assume that you are developing iOS and Android applications using Kotlin Multiplatform and you want to
generate a universally unique identifier (UUID):

![Expect/actual declarations for getting the UUID](expect-actual-example.png){width=700}

For this purpose, declare the expected function `randomUUID()` with the `expect` keyword in the common module.
Don't include any implementation code.

```kotlin
// Common
expect fun randomUUID(): String
```

In each platform-specific module (iOS and Android), provide the actual implementation for the function `randomUUID()`
expected in the common module. Use the `actual` keyword to mark the actual implementation.

The following examples show the implementation of this for Android and iOS.
Platform-specific code uses the `actual` keyword and the expected name for the function.

```kotlin
// Android
import java.util.*

actual fun randomUUID() = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
```

```kotlin
// iOS
import platform.Foundation.NSUUID

actual fun randomUUID(): String = NSUUID().UUIDString()
```

#### Implement a logging framework {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Another example of code sharing and interaction between the common and platform logic, JS and JVM in this case, in a minimalistic
logging framework:

```kotlin
// Common
enum class LogLevel {
    DEBUG, WARN, ERROR
}

internal expect fun writeLogMessage(message: String, logLevel: LogLevel) 

fun logDebug(message: String) = writeLogMessage(message, LogLevel.DEBUG)
fun logWarn(message: String) = writeLogMessage(message, LogLevel.WARN)
fun logError(message: String) = writeLogMessage(message, LogLevel.ERROR)
```

```kotlin
// JVM
internal actual fun writeLogMessage(message: String, logLevel: LogLevel) {
    println("[$logLevel]: $message")
}
```

For JavaScript, a completely different set of APIs is available, and the `actual` declaration will look like this.

```kotlin
// JS
internal actual fun writeLogMessage(message: String, logLevel: LogLevel) {
    when (logLevel) {
        LogLevel.DEBUG -> console.log(message)
        LogLevel.WARN -> console.warn(message)
        LogLevel.ERROR -> console.error(message)
    }
}
```

#### Send and receive messages from a WebSocket {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Consider developing a chat platform for iOS and Android using Kotlin Multiplatform.
Let's see how you can implement sending and receiving messages from a WebSocket.

For this purpose, define a common logic that you don't need to duplicate in all platform modules â€“
just add it once to the common module. However, the actual implementation of the WebSocket class differs
from platform to platform. That's why you should use `expect`/`actual` declarations for this class.

In the common module, declare the expected class `PlatformSocket()` with the `expect` keyword. Don't include any implementation code.

```kotlin
//Common
internal expect class PlatformSocket(
    url: String
) {
    fun openSocket(listener: PlatformSocketListener)
    fun closeSocket(code: Int, reason: String)
    fun sendMessage(msg: String)
}
interface PlatformSocketListener {
    fun onOpen()
    fun onFailure(t: Throwable)
    fun onMessage(msg: String)
    fun onClosing(code: Int, reason: String)
    fun onClosed(code: Int, reason: String)
}
```

In each platform-specific module (iOS and Android), provide the actual implementation for the class `PlatformSocket()`
expected in the common module. Use the `actual` keyword to mark the actual implementation.

The following examples show the implementation of this for Android and iOS.

```kotlin
//Android
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import okhttp3.Request
import okhttp3.Response
import okhttp3.WebSocket

internal actual class PlatformSocket actual constructor(url: String) {
    private val socketEndpoint = url
    private var webSocket: WebSocket? = null
    actual fun openSocket(listener: PlatformSocketListener) {
        val socketRequest = Request.Builder().url(socketEndpoint).build()
        val webClient = OkHttpClient().newBuilder().build()
        webSocket = webClient.newWebSocket(
            socketRequest,
            object : okhttp3.WebSocketListener() {
                override fun onOpen(webSocket: WebSocket, response: Response) = listener.onOpen()
                override fun onFailure(webSocket: WebSocket, t: Throwable, response: Response?) = listener.onFailure(t)
                override fun onMessage(webSocket: WebSocket, text: String) = listener.onMessage(text)
                override fun onClosing(webSocket: WebSocket, code: Int, reason: String) = listener.onClosing(code, reason)
                override fun onClosed(webSocket: WebSocket, code: Int, reason: String) = listener.onClosed(code, reason)
            }
        )
    }
    actual fun closeSocket(code: Int, reason: String) {
        webSocket?.close(code, reason)
        webSocket = null
    }
    actual fun sendMessage(msg: String) {
        webSocket?.send(msg)
    }
}
```

Android implementation uses the third-party library [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/). Add the corresponding dependency to `build.gradle(.kts)` in the shared module:

<tabs group="build-script">
<tab title="Kotlin" group-key="kotlin">

```kotlin
sourceSets {
    val androidMain by getting {
        dependencies {
            implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:$okhttp_version")
        }
    }
}
```

</tab>
<tab title="Groovy" group-key="groovy">

```groovy
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation "com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:$okhttp_version"
    }
}
```

</tab>
</tabs>

iOS implementation uses `NSURLSession` from the standard Apple SDK and doesn't require additional dependencies.

```kotlin
//iOS
import platform.Foundation.*
import platform.darwin.NSObject

internal actual class PlatformSocket actual constructor(url: String) {
    private val socketEndpoint = NSURL.URLWithString(url)!!
    private var webSocket: NSURLSessionWebSocketTask? = null
    actual fun openSocket(listener: PlatformSocketListener) {
        val urlSession = NSURLSession.sessionWithConfiguration(
            configuration = NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration(),
            delegate = object : NSObject(), NSURLSessionWebSocketDelegateProtocol {
                override fun URLSession(
                    session: NSURLSession,
                    webSocketTask: NSURLSessionWebSocketTask,
                    didOpenWithProtocol: String?
                ) {
                    listener.onOpen()
                }
                override fun URLSession(
                    session: NSURLSession,
                    webSocketTask: NSURLSessionWebSocketTask,
                    didCloseWithCode: NSURLSessionWebSocketCloseCode,
                    reason: NSData?
                ) {
                    listener.onClosed(didCloseWithCode.toInt(), reason.toString())
                }
            },
            delegateQueue = NSOperationQueue.currentQueue()
        )
        webSocket = urlSession.webSocketTaskWithURL(socketEndpoint)
        listenMessages(listener)
        webSocket?.resume()
    }
    private fun listenMessages(listener: PlatformSocketListener) {
        webSocket?.receiveMessageWithCompletionHandler { message, nsError ->
            when {
                nsError != null -> {
                    listener.onFailure(Throwable(nsError.description))
                }
                message != null -> {
                    message.string?.let { listener.onMessage(it) }
                }
            }
            listenMessages(listener)
        }
    }
    actual fun closeSocket(code: Int, reason: String) {
        webSocket?.cancelWithCloseCode(code.toLong(), null)
        webSocket = null
    }
    actual fun sendMessage(msg: String) {
        val message = NSURLSessionWebSocketMessage(msg)
        webSocket?.sendMessage(message) { err ->
            err?.let { println("send $msg error: $it") }
        }
    }
}
```

And here is the common logic in the common module that uses the platform-specific class `PlatformSocket()`.

```kotlin
//Common
class AppSocket(url: String) {
    private val ws = PlatformSocket(url)
    var socketError: Throwable? = null
        private set
    var currentState: State = State.CLOSED
        private set(value) {
            field = value
            stateListener?.invoke(value)
        }
    var stateListener: ((State) -> Unit)? = null
        set(value) {
            field = value
            value?.invoke(currentState)
        }
    var messageListener: ((msg: String) -> Unit)? = null
    fun connect() {
        if (currentState != State.CLOSED) {
            throw IllegalStateException("The socket is available.")
        }
        socketError = null
        currentState = State.CONNECTING
        ws.openSocket(socketListener)
    }
    fun disconnect() {
        if (currentState != State.CLOSED) {
            currentState = State.CLOSING
            ws.closeSocket(1000, "The user has closed the connection.")
        }
    }
    fun send(msg: String) {
        if (currentState != State.CONNECTED) throw IllegalStateException("The connection is lost.")
        ws.sendMessage(msg)
    }
    private val socketListener = object : PlatformSocketListener {
        override fun onOpen() {
            currentState = State.CONNECTED
        }
        override fun onFailure(t: Throwable) {
            socketError = t
            currentState = State.CLOSED
        }
        override fun onMessage(msg: String) {
            messageListener?.invoke(msg)
        }
        override fun onClosing(code: Int, reason: String) {
            currentState = State.CLOSING
        }
        override fun onClosed(code: Int, reason: String) {
            currentState = State.CLOSED
        }
    }
    enum class State {
        CONNECTING,
        CONNECTED,
        CLOSING,
        CLOSED
    }
}
```

## Avoid overusing expect and actuals

The `expect` keyword can be used with most Kotlin constructs, meaning any given problem has multiple solutions. However,
it could lead to overusing the feature, especially during the initial design.

Consider this implementation of the `Identity` type containing the user login name and the process ID. It uses the
mechanism of expected and actual declarations to work on JVM and in native environments like iOS.

The project has the `commonMain`, `jvmMain`, and `nativeMain` source sets:

* The `commonMain` source set declares the `Identity` type with `expect`:

  ```kotlin
  expect class Identity() {
      val userName: String
      val processID: Int
  }
  ```

* `jvmMain` implements a solution using standard Java libraries:

  ```kotlin
  import java.lang.System.getProperty
  import java.lang.ProcessHandle.current
  
  actual class Identity {
      actual val userName: String
      actual val processID: Long
      
      init {
          userName = getProperty("user.name") ?: "none"
          processID = current().pid()
      }
  }
  ```

* `nativeMain` implements a solution using [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX):

  ```kotlin
  import kotlinx.cinterop.toKString
  import platform.posix.getlogin
  import platform.posix.getpid
  
  actual class Identity {
      actual val userName: String
      actual val processID: Long
  
  
      init {
          userName = getlogin()?.toKString() ?: "None"
          processID = getpid().toLong()
      }
  }
  ```

This approach works but introduces a lot of complexity; you have to implement the type for every supported platform.

Check out a couple of options on how it can be refactored into something simpler.

### Option 1. Factory functions

A simpler solution is to have a single `Identity` type and encapsulate the platform-specific differences into a factory
function:

1. In `commonMain`, declare a simple type and expect a factory function:

  ```kotlin
  expect fun buildIdentity(): Identity
  
  class Identity(val userName: String, val processID: Long)
  ```

2. Implement the actual function in jvmMain:

  ```kotlin
  // In jvmMain:
  actual fun buildIdentity() = Identity(
          getProperty("user.name") ?: "none",
          current().pid()
      )
  ```

3. And in `nativeMain`:

  ```kotlin
  // In nativeMain:
  actual fun buildIdentity() = Identity(
      getlogin()?.toKString() ?: "None",
      getpid().toLong()
  )
  ```

This solution is easier to understand and requires less code. As a general rule, try to limit the use of expected and
actual declarations and rely on standard language constructs wherever possible.

### Option 2. Interfaces

In some cases, the previous approach doesn't work. Platform-specific logic could be too big or complex to encapsulate in
a factory function.

If this is the case, you can use standard language constructs, like interfaces:

In `commonMain`, declare the same types as above, but this time, create the `Identity` type with an `IdentityBuilder`
implemented by a factory function:

```kotlin
expect fun identityBuilder(): IdentityBuilder

interface IdentityBuilder {
    fun build(): Identity
}

class Identity(val userName: String, val processID: Long)
```

Create platform-specific implementations of the interface without additional use of `expect` and `actual`:

```kotlin
// In `jvmMain`:
actual fun identityBuilder(): IdentityBuilder = JvmIdentityProvider()

class JvmIdentityBuilder : IdentityBuilder {
    override fun build() = Identity(
        getProperty("user.name") ?: "none",
        current().pid()
    )
}

// In `nativeMain`:
actual fun identityBuilder(): IdentityBuilder = NativeIdentityProvider()

class NativeIdentityBuilder : IdentityBuilder {
    override fun build() = Identity(
        getlogin()?.toKString() ?: "None",
        getpid().toLong()
    )
}
```

The `JvmIdentityBuilder` and `NativeIdentityBuilder` types can be expanded as much as required, for example, with helper
functions and supporting types.

### Option 3. Inheritance

There are special cases when using the `expect` keyword with classes is the best approach. Let's say that the `Identity`
type already exists on JVM:

```kotlin
open class Identity {
    val login: String
    val pid: Long


    init {
        login = getProperty("user.name") ?: "none"
        pid = current().pid()
    }
}
```

To fit it in the existing codebase and frameworks, your implementation of the `Identity` type should inherit from this
type and reuse its functionality:

1. To solve this problem, declare a class in `commonMain` using the `expect` keyword:

  ```kotlin
  expect class CommonIdentity() {
      val userName: String
      val processID: Long
  }
  ```

2. In `nativeMain`, provide an actual declaration that implements the functionality:

  ```kotlin
  actual class CommonIdentity {
      actual val userName = getlogin()?.toKString() ?: "None"
      actual val processID = getpid().toLong()
  }
  ```

3. In `jvmMain`, provide an actual declaration that inherits from the platform-specific base class:

  ```kotlin
  actual class CommonIdentity : Identity() {
      actual val userName = login
      actual val processID = pid
  }
  ```

Here, the `CommonIdentity` type is compatible with both your own design and the existing architecture.

## For framework authors

If you're a framework author, you can also find expected and actual declarations useful for your framework.

Imagine that the example above is a part of a framework. The user has to derive a type from `CommonIdentity` to provide
a display name.

In this case, the expected declaration is abstract and declares an abstract value:

```kotlin
// commonMain of the framework codebase:
expect abstract class CommonIdentity() {
    val userName: String
    val processID: Long
    abstract val displayName: String
}
```

Similarly, actual implementations are abstract as well and declare the `displayName` value:

```kotlin
// nativeMain of the framework codebase:
actual abstract class CommonIdentity {
    actual val userName = getlogin()?.toKString() ?: "None"
    actual val processID = getpid().toLong()
    actual abstract val displayName: String
}

// jvmMain of the framework codebase:
actual abstract class CommonIdentity : Identity() {
    actual val userName = login
    actual val processID = pid
    actual abstract val displayName: String
}
```

The framework users then need to write common code that inherits from the expected declaration and implement the missing
value themselves:

```kotlin
// commonMain of the users' codebase:
class MyCommonIdentity : CommonIdentity() {
    override val displayName = "Admin"
}
```

You'll end up with the following relationship between declarations:

A similar scheme works in any library that provides a common `ViewModel`. Such a library typically provides an
expected `CommonViewModel` class, whose actual Android counterpart extends the `ViewModel` class from the Android
framework.

When users compile their code, the expected declaration they inherit from is replaced with the actual implementation
corresponding to the current platform. This helps the framework to operate as a multiplatform library.
