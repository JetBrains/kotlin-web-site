Support for multiplatform programming is one of Kotlin's key benefits. It reduces time spent writing and maintaining the 
same code for [different platforms](multiplatform-dsl-reference.md#targets) while retaining the flexibility and benefits of native programming.   

Learn more about [Kotlin Multiplatform benefits](multiplatform.md).

## Start from scratch

* [Get started with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-create-first-app.html). Create your first cross-platform 
  application that works on Android and iOS with the help of the [Kotlin Multiplatform plugin for Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile).
  Learn how to create, run, and add dependencies to multiplatform mobile applications.
* [Share UIs between iOS and Android](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.html).
  Create a Kotlin Multiplatform application that uses the [Compose Multiplatform UI framework](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
  for sharing business logic and UIs among the iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

## Dive deep into Kotlin Multiplatform

Once you have gained some experience with Kotlin Multiplatform and want to know how to solve particular cross-platform development tasks:

* [Share code on platforms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md) in your Kotlin Multiplatform project.
* [Connect to platform-specific APIs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-connect-to-apis.html) when developing multiplatform applications and libraries.
* [Set up targets manually](multiplatform-set-up-targets.md) for your Kotlin Multiplatform project.
* [Add dependencies](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) on the standard, test, or another kotlinx library.
* [Configure compilations](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) for production and test purposes in your project.
* [Publish a multiplatform library](multiplatform-publish-lib.md) to the Maven repository.
* [Build native binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md) as executables or shared libraries, like universal frameworks or XCFrameworks.
