[//]: # (title: Type checks and casts)

In Kotlin, you can perform type checks to check the type of an object at runtime. Type casts enable you to convert objects to a 
different type.

## is and !is operators

To perform a runtime check that identifies whether an object conforms to a given type, use the `is` operator or its negated form `!is`:

```kotlin
if (obj is String) {
    print(obj.length)
}

if (obj !is String) { // Same as !(obj is String)
    print("Not a String")
} else {
    print(obj.length)
}
```

## Smart casts

In most cases, you don't need to use explicit cast operators because the compiler automatically casts objects for you.
This is called smart-casting. The compiler tracks the type checks and [explicit casts](#unsafe-cast-operator) for immutable
values and inserts implicit (safe) casts automatically when necessary:

```kotlin
fun demo(x: Any) {
    if (x is String) {
        print(x.length) // x is automatically cast to String
    }
}
```

The compiler is even smart enough to know that a cast is safe if a negative check leads to a return:

```kotlin
if (x !is String) return

print(x.length) // x is automatically cast to String
```

### Control flow

Smart casts work not only for `if` conditional expressions but also for [`when` expressions](control-flow.md#when-expressions-and-statements)
and [`while` loops](control-flow.md#while-loops):

```kotlin
when (x) {
    is Int -> print(x + 1)
    is String -> print(x.length + 1)
    is IntArray -> print(x.sum())
}
```

If you declare a variable of `Boolean` type before using it in your `if`, `when`, or `while` condition, then any
information collected by the compiler about the variable will be accessible in the corresponding block for
smart-casting.

This can be useful when you want to do things like extract boolean conditions into variables. Then, you can give the
variable a meaningful name, which will improve your code readability and make it possible to reuse the variable later
in your code. For example:

```kotlin
class Cat {
    fun purr() {
        println("Purr purr")
    }
}

fun petAnimal(animal: Any) {
    val isCat = animal is Cat
    if (isCat) {
        // The compiler can access information about
        // isCat, so it knows that animal was smart-cast
        // to the type Cat.
        // Therefore, the purr() function can be called.
        animal.purr()
    }
}

fun main(){
    val kitty = Cat()
    petAnimal(kitty)
    // Purr purr
}
```

### Logical operators

The compiler can perform smart casts on the right-hand side of `&&` or `||` operators if there is a type check (regular or negative) on the left-hand side:

```kotlin
// x is automatically cast to String on the right-hand side of `||`
if (x !is String || x.length == 0) return

// x is automatically cast to String on the right-hand side of `&&`
if (x is String && x.length > 0) {
    print(x.length) // x is automatically cast to String
}
```

If you combine type checks for objects with an `or` operator (`||`), a smart cast is made to their closest common supertype:

```kotlin
interface Status {
    fun signal() {}
}

interface Ok : Status
interface Postponed : Status
interface Declined : Status

fun signalCheck(signalStatus: Any) {
    if (signalStatus is Postponed || signalStatus is Declined) {
        // signalStatus is smart-cast to a common supertype Status
        signalStatus.signal()
    }
}
```

> The common supertype is an **approximation** of a [union type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type). Union types
> are [not currently supported in Kotlin](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-13108/Denotable-union-and-intersection-types).

### Inline functions

The compiler can smart-cast variables captured within lambda functions that are passed to [inline functions](inline-functions.md).

Inline functions are treated as having an implicit [`callsInPlace`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.contracts/-contract-builder/calls-in-place.html)
contract. This means that any lambda functions passed to an inline function are called in place. Since lambda functions
are called in place, the compiler knows that a lambda function can't leak references to any variables contained within
its function body.

The compiler uses this knowledge, along with other analyses to decide whether it's safe to smart-cast any of the
captured variables. For example:

```kotlin
interface Processor {
    fun process()
}

inline fun inlineAction(f: () -> Unit) = f()

fun nextProcessor(): Processor? = null

fun runProcessor(): Processor? {
    var processor: Processor? = null
    inlineAction {
        // The compiler knows that processor is a local variable and inlineAction()
        // is an inline function, so references to processor can't be leaked.
        // Therefore, it's safe to smart-cast processor.
      
        // If processor isn't null, processor is smart-cast
        if (processor != null) {
            // The compiler knows that processor isn't null, so no safe call 
            // is needed
            processor.process()
        }

        processor = nextProcessor()
    }

    return processor
}
```

### Exception handling

Smart cast information is passed on to `catch` and `finally` blocks. This makes your code safer
as the compiler tracks whether your object has a nullable type. For example:

```kotlin
//sampleStart
fun testString() {
    var stringInput: String? = null
    // stringInput is smart-cast to String type
    stringInput = ""
    try {
        // The compiler knows that stringInput isn't null
        println(stringInput.length)
        // 0

        // The compiler rejects previous smart cast information for 
        // stringInput. Now stringInput has the String? type.
        stringInput = null

        // Trigger an exception
        if (2 > 1) throw Exception()
        stringInput = ""
    } catch (exception: Exception) {
        // The compiler knows stringInput can be null
        // so stringInput stays nullable.
        println(stringInput?.length)
        // null
    }
}
//sampleEnd
fun main() {
    testString()
}
```

### Smart cast prerequisites

Smart casts can be used in the following conditions:

<table style="none">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>val</code> local variables
        </td>
        <td>
            Always, except <a href="delegated-properties.md">local delegated properties</a>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>val</code> properties
        </td>
        <td>
            If the property is <code>private</code>, <code>internal</code>, or if the check is performed in the same <a href="visibility-modifiers.md#modules">module</a> where the property is declared. Smart casts can't be used on <code>open</code> properties or properties that have custom getters.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>var</code> local variables
        </td>
        <td>
            If the variable is not modified between the check and its usage, is not captured in a lambda that modifies it, and is not a local delegated property.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>var</code> properties
        </td>
        <td>
            Never, because the variable can be modified at any time by other code.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## "Unsafe" cast operator

To explicitly cast an object to a non-nullable type, use the *unsafe* cast operator `as`:

```kotlin
val x: String = y as String
```

If the cast isn't possible, the compiler throws an exception. This is why it's called _unsafe_.

In the previous example, if `y` is `null`, the code above also throws an exception. This is because `null` can't be cast
to `String`, as `String` isn't [nullable](null-safety.md). To make the example work for possible null values, use a nullable
type on the right-hand side of the cast:

```kotlin
val x: String? = y as String?
```

## "Safe" (nullable) cast operator

To avoid exceptions, use the *safe* cast operator `as?`, which returns `null` on failure.

```kotlin
val x: String? = y as? String
```

Note that despite the fact that the right-hand side of `as?` is a non-nullable type `String`, the result of the cast is nullable.
