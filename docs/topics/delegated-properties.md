[//]: # (title: Delegated properties)

There are certain common kinds of properties, that, though you can implement them manually every time you need them, 
it would be helpful to implement them once and add to a library. Examples include:

* _Lazy_ properties: the value gets computed only upon first access.
* _Observable_ properties: listeners get notified about changes to this property.
* Storing properties in a _map_, instead of a separate field for each property.

To cover these (and other) cases, Kotlin supports _delegated properties_:

```kotlin
class Example {
    var p: String by Delegate()
}
```

The syntax is: `val/var <property name>: <Type> by <expression>`. The expression after `by` is a _delegate_, 
because `get()` (and `set()`) corresponding to the property will be delegated to its `getValue()` and `setValue()` methods.
Property delegates don’t have to implement any interface, but they have to provide a `getValue()` function (and `setValue()` --- for `var`s).

For example:

```kotlin
import kotlin.reflect.KProperty

class Delegate {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): String {
        return "$thisRef, thank you for delegating '${property.name}' to me!"
    }
 
    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, value: String) {
        println("$value has been assigned to '${property.name}' in $thisRef.")
    }
}
```

When you read from `p` that delegates to an instance of `Delegate`, the `getValue()` function from `Delegate` is called,
so that its first parameter is the object you read `p` from and the second parameter holds a description of `p` itself 
(for example, you can take its name). 

```kotlin
val e = Example()
println(e.p)
```

This prints:

```
Example@33a17727, thank you for delegating ‘p’ to me!
```
 
Similarly, when you assign to `p`, the `setValue()` function is called. The first two parameters are the same, and 
the third holds the value being assigned:

```kotlin
e.p = "NEW"
```

This prints
 
```
NEW has been assigned to ‘p’ in Example@33a17727.
```

The specification of the requirements to the delegated object can be found [below](#property-delegate-requirements).

Note that you can declare a delegated property inside a function or code block, it shouldn't necessarily be a member of a class.
Below you can find [an example](#local-delegated-properties).

## Standard delegates

The Kotlin standard library provides factory methods for several useful kinds of delegates.

### Lazy properties

[`lazy()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/lazy.html) is a function that takes a lambda and returns an instance of `Lazy<T>` which can serve as a delegate for implementing a lazy property:
the first call to `get()` executes the lambda passed to `lazy()` and remembers the result, 
subsequent calls to `get()` simply return the remembered result. 

```kotlin
val lazyValue: String by lazy {
    println("computed!")
    "Hello"
}

fun main() {
    println(lazyValue)
    println(lazyValue)
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

By default, the evaluation of lazy properties is *synchronized*: the value is computed only in one thread, and all threads
will see the same value. If the synchronization of initialization delegate is not required, so that multiple threads
can execute it simultaneously, pass `LazyThreadSafetyMode.PUBLICATION` as a parameter to the `lazy()` function. 

And if you're sure that the initialization will always happen on the same thread as the one where you use the property,
you can use `LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE`: it doesn't incur any thread-safety guarantees and the related overhead.

### Observable properties

[`Delegates.observable()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.properties/-delegates/observable.html)
takes two arguments: the initial value and a handler for modifications.

The handler is called every time you assign to the property (*after* the assignment has been performed). It has three
parameters: a property being assigned to, the old value and the new one:

```kotlin
import kotlin.properties.Delegates

class User {
    var name: String by Delegates.observable("<no name>") {
        prop, old, new ->
        println("$old -> $new")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val user = User()
    user.name = "first"
    user.name = "second"
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

If you want to intercept assignments and *veto* them, use [`vetoable()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.properties/-delegates/vetoable.html) instead of `observable()`.
The handler passed to the `vetoable` is called *before* the assignment of a new property value.

## Delegating to another property

A property can delegate its getter and setter to another property. Such delegation is available for
both top-level and class properties (member and extension). The delegate property can be:
- a top-level property
- a member or an extension property of the same class
- a member or an extension property of another class

To delegate a property to another property, use the proper `::` qualifier in the delegate name, for example, `this::delegate` or
`MyClass::delegate`.

```kotlin
var topLevelInt: Int = 0
class ClassWithDelegate(val anotherClassInt: Int)

class MyClass(var memberInt: Int, val anotherClassInstance: ClassWithDelegate) {
    var delegatedToMember: Int by this::memberInt
    var delegatedToTopLevel: Int by ::topLevelInt
    
    val delegatedToAnotherClass: Int by anotherClassInstance::anotherClassInt
}
var MyClass.extDelegated: Int by ::topLevelInt
```

This may be useful, for example, when you want to rename a property in a backward-compatible way: you introduce a new property,
annotate the old one with the `@Deprecated` annotation, and delegate its implementation.

```kotlin
class MyClass {
   var newName: Int = 0
   @Deprecated("Use 'newName' instead", ReplaceWith("newName"))
   var oldName: Int by this::newName
}
fun main() {
   val myClass = MyClass()
   // Notification: 'oldName: Int' is deprecated.
   // Use 'newName' instead
   myClass.oldName = 42
   println(myClass.newName) // 42
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.4"}

## Storing properties in a map

One common use case is storing the values of properties in a map.
This comes up often in applications like parsing JSON or doing other “dynamic” things.
In this case, you can use the map instance itself as the delegate for a delegated property.

```kotlin
class User(val map: Map<String, Any?>) {
    val name: String by map
    val age: Int     by map
}
```

In this example, the constructor takes a map:

```kotlin
val user = User(mapOf(
    "name" to "John Doe",
    "age"  to 25
))
```

Delegated properties take values from this map (by the string keys – names of properties):

```kotlin
class User(val map: Map<String, Any?>) {
    val name: String by map
    val age: Int     by map
}

fun main() {
    val user = User(mapOf(
        "name" to "John Doe",
        "age"  to 25
    ))
//sampleStart
    println(user.name) // Prints "John Doe"
    println(user.age)  // Prints 25
//sampleEnd
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true"}

This works also for `var`’s properties if you use a `MutableMap` instead of read-only `Map`:

```kotlin
class MutableUser(val map: MutableMap<String, Any?>) {
    var name: String by map
    var age: Int     by map
}
```

## Local delegated properties

You can declare local variables as delegated properties.
For example, you can make a local variable lazy:

```kotlin
fun example(computeFoo: () -> Foo) {
    val memoizedFoo by lazy(computeFoo)

    if (someCondition && memoizedFoo.isValid()) {
        memoizedFoo.doSomething()
    }
}
```

The `memoizedFoo` variable will be computed on the first access only.
If `someCondition` fails, the variable won't be computed at all.

## Property delegate requirements

Here are requirements for delegating properties. 

For a *read-only* property (`val`), a delegate should provide an operator function `getValue()` with the following parameters:

* `thisRef` must be the same or a supertype of the *property owner* (for extension properties, it should be the type being extended).
* `property`  must be of type `KProperty<*>` or its supertype.
 
`getValue()` must return the same type as the property (or its subtype).

```kotlin
class Resource

class Owner {
    val valResource: Resource by ResourceDelegate()
}

class ResourceDelegate {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Owner, property: KProperty<*>): Resource {
        return Resource()
    }
}
```

For a *mutable* property (`var`), a delegate has to additionally provide an operator function `setValue()` 
with the following parameters:

* `thisRef` must be the same or a supertype of the *property owner* (for extension properties, it should be the type being extended).
* `property` must be of type `KProperty<*>` or its supertype.
* `value` must be of the same type as the property (or its supertype).
 
```kotlin
class Resource

class Owner {
    var varResource: Resource by ResourceDelegate()
}

class ResourceDelegate(private var resource: Resource = Resource()) {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Owner, property: KProperty<*>): Resource {
        return resource
    }
    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Owner, property: KProperty<*>, value: Any?) {
        if (value is Resource) {
            resource = value
        }
    }
}
```

`getValue()` and/or `setValue()` functions can be provided either as member functions of the delegate class or extension functions.
The latter is handy when you need to delegate property to an object which doesn't originally provide these functions.
Both of the functions need to be marked with the `operator` keyword.

You can create delegates as anonymous objects without creating new classes using the interfaces `ReadOnlyProperty` and `ReadWriteProperty` from the Kotlin standard library. 
They provide the required methods: `getValue()` is declared in `ReadOnlyProperty`; `ReadWriteProperty` 
extends it and adds `setValue()`. Thus, you can pass a `ReadWriteProperty` whenever a `ReadOnlyProperty` is expected.

```kotlin
fun resourceDelegate(): ReadWriteProperty<Any?, Int> =
    object : ReadWriteProperty<Any?, Int> {
        var curValue = 0 
        override fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): Int = curValue
        override fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, value: Int) {
            curValue = value
        }
    }

val readOnly: Int by resourceDelegate()  // ReadWriteProperty as val
var readWrite: Int by resourceDelegate()
```

### Translation rules

Under the hood for every delegated property the Kotlin compiler generates an auxiliary property and delegates to it.
For example, for the property `prop` the hidden property `prop$delegate` is generated, and the code of the accessors 
simply delegates to this additional property:

```kotlin
class C {
    var prop: Type by MyDelegate()
}

// this code is generated by the compiler instead:
class C {
    private val prop$delegate = MyDelegate()
    var prop: Type
        get() = prop$delegate.getValue(this, this::prop)
        set(value: Type) = prop$delegate.setValue(this, this::prop, value)
}
```

The Kotlin compiler provides all the necessary information about `prop` in the arguments: the first argument `this` 
refers to an instance of the outer class `C` and `this::prop` is a reflection object of the `KProperty` type describing `prop` itself.

### Providing a delegate

By defining the `provideDelegate` operator you can extend the logic of creating the object to which the property implementation
is delegated. If the object used on the right-hand side of `by` defines `provideDelegate` as a member or extension function,
that function will be called to create the property delegate instance.

One of the possible use cases of `provideDelegate` is to check the consistency of the property upon its initialization.

For example, if you want to check the property name before binding, you can write something like this:

```kotlin
class ResourceDelegate<T> : ReadOnlyProperty<MyUI, T> {
    override fun getValue(thisRef: MyUI, property: KProperty<*>): T { ... }
}
    
class ResourceLoader<T>(id: ResourceID<T>) {
    operator fun provideDelegate(
            thisRef: MyUI,
            prop: KProperty<*>
    ): ReadOnlyProperty<MyUI, T> {
        checkProperty(thisRef, prop.name)
        // create delegate
        return ResourceDelegate()
    }

    private fun checkProperty(thisRef: MyUI, name: String) { ... }
}

class MyUI {
    fun <T> bindResource(id: ResourceID<T>): ResourceLoader<T> { ... }

    val image by bindResource(ResourceID.image_id)
    val text by bindResource(ResourceID.text_id)
}
```

The parameters of `provideDelegate` are the same as for `getValue`:

* `thisRef` must be the same or a supertype of the _property owner_ (for extension properties, it should be the type being extended);
* `property` must be of type `KProperty<*>` or its supertype.

The `provideDelegate` method is called for each property during the creation of the `MyUI` instance, and it performs 
the necessary validation right away.

Without this ability to intercept the binding between the property and its delegate, to achieve the same functionality
you'd have to pass the property name explicitly, which isn't very convenient:

```kotlin
// Checking the property name without "provideDelegate" functionality
class MyUI {
    val image by bindResource(ResourceID.image_id, "image")
    val text by bindResource(ResourceID.text_id, "text")
}

fun <T> MyUI.bindResource(
        id: ResourceID<T>,
        propertyName: String
): ReadOnlyProperty<MyUI, T> {
    checkProperty(this, propertyName)
    // create delegate
}
```

In the generated code, the `provideDelegate` method is called to initialize the auxiliary `prop$delegate` property.
Compare the generated code for the property declaration `val prop: Type by MyDelegate()` with the generated code 
[above](#translation-rules) (when the `provideDelegate` method is not present):

```kotlin
class C {
    var prop: Type by MyDelegate()
}

// this code is generated by the compiler 
// when the 'provideDelegate' function is available:
class C {
    // calling "provideDelegate" to create the additional "delegate" property
    private val prop$delegate = MyDelegate().provideDelegate(this, this::prop)
    var prop: Type
        get() = prop$delegate.getValue(this, this::prop)
        set(value: Type) = prop$delegate.setValue(this, this::prop, value)
}
```

Note that the `provideDelegate` method affects only the creation of the auxiliary property and doesn't affect the code
generated for getter or setter.

With the `PropertyDelegateProvider` interface from the standard library, you can create delegate providers without creating new classes.

```kotlin
val provider = PropertyDelegateProvider { thisRef: Any?, property ->
    ReadOnlyProperty<Any?, Int> {_, property -> 42 }
}
val delegate: Int by provider
```
