## New Kotlin K2 compiler updates

The Kotlin team continues to stabilize the K2 compiler. As mentioned in
the [Kotlin 1.7.0 announcement](whatsnew17.md#new-kotlin-k2-compiler-for-the-jvm-in-alpha), it's still in **Alpha**.
This release introduces further improvements on the road to [K2 Beta](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-52604).

Starting with this 1.8.20 release, the Kotlin K2 compiler:

* Has a preview version of the serialization plugin.
* Provides Alpha support for the [JS IR compiler](js-ir-compiler.md).
* Introduces the future release of
  the [new language version, Kotlin 2.0](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2023/02/k2-kotlin-2-0/).

Learn more about the new compiler and its benefits in the following videos:

* [What Everyone Must Know About The NEW Kotlin K2 Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTdJJq_LyoY)
* [The New Kotlin K2 Compiler: Expert Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db19VFLZqJM)

### How to enable the Kotlin K2 compiler

To enable and test the Kotlin K2 compiler, use the new language version with the following compiler option:

```bash
-language-version 2.0
```

You can specify it in your `build.gradle(.kts)` file:

```kotlin
kotlin {
   sourceSets.all {
       languageSettings {
           languageVersion = "2.0"
       }
   }
}
```

The previous `-Xuse-k2` compiler option has been deprecated.

> The Alpha version of the new K2 compiler only works with JVM and JS IR projects.
> It doesn't support Kotlin/Native or any of the multiplatform projects yet.

## Language

As Kotlin continues to evolve, we're introducing preview versions for new language features in 1.8.20:

* [A modern and performant replacement of the Enum class values function](#a-modern-and-performant-replacement-of-the-enum-class-values-function)
* [Data objects for symmetry with data classes](#preview-of-data-objects-for-symmetry-with-data-classes)
* [Lifting restrictions on secondary constructors with bodies in inline classes](#preview-of-lifting-restriction-on-secondary-constructors-with-bodies-in-inline-classes)

### A modern and performant replacement of the Enum class values function

> This feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> It may be dropped or changed at any time. Opt-in is required (see details below). Use it only for evaluation purposes.
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

{style="warning"}

Enum classes have a synthetic `values()` function, which returns an array of defined enum constants. However, using an
array can lead to [hidden performance issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/enum-entries.md#examples-of-performance-issues)
in Kotlin and Java. In addition, most of the APIs use collections, which require eventual conversion. To fix these
problems, we've introduced the `entries` property for Enum classes, which should be used instead of the `values()`
function. When called, the `entries` property returns a pre-allocated immutable list of defined enum constants.

> The `values()` function is still supported, but we recommend that you use the `entries` property
> instead.

{style="tip"}

```kotlin
enum class Color(val colorName: String, val rgb: String) {
    RED("Red", "#FF0000"),
    ORANGE("Orange", "#FF7F00"),
    YELLOW("Yellow", "#FFFF00")
}

@OptIn(ExperimentalStdlibApi::class)
fun findByRgb(rgb: String): Color? = Color.entries.find { it.rgb == rgb }
```
{validate="false"}

#### How to enable the entries property

To try this feature out, opt in with `@OptIn(ExperimentalStdlibApi)` and enable the `-language-version 1.9` compiler
option. In a Gradle project, you can do so by adding the following to your `build.gradle(.kts)` file:

<tabs group="build-script">
<tab title="Kotlin" group-key="kotlin">

```kotlin
tasks
    .withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompilationTask<*>>()
    .configureEach {
        compilerOptions
            .languageVersion
            .set(
                org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
            )
    }
```

</tab>
<tab title="Groovy" group-key="groovy">

```groovy
tasks
    .withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompilationTask.class)
    .configureEach {
        compilerOptions.languageVersion =
            org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
    }
```

</tab>
</tabs>

> Starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, if you have opted in to this feature, the appropriate IDE
> inspection will notify you about converting from `values()` to `entries` and offer a quick-fix.

### Preview of data objects for symmetry with data classes

Data objects allow you to declare objects with singleton semantics and a clean `toString()` representation. In this
snippet, you can see how adding the `data` keyword to an object declaration improves the readability of its `toString()`
output:

```kotlin
package org.example
object MyObject
data object MyDataObject

fun main() {
    println(MyObject) // org.example.MyObject@1f32e575
    println(MyDataObject) // MyDataObject
}
```

Especially for `sealed` hierarchies (like a `sealed class` or `sealed interface` hierarchy), `data objects` are an
excellent fit because they can be used conveniently alongside `data class` declarations. In this snippet,
declaring `EndOfFile` as a `data object` instead of a plain `object` means that it will get a pretty `toString` without
the need to override it manually. This maintains symmetry with the accompanying data class definitions.

```kotlin
sealed interface ReadResult
data class Number(val number: Int) : ReadResult
data class Text(val text: String) : ReadResult
data object EndOfFile : ReadResult

fun main() {
    println(Number(7)) // Number(number=7)
    println(EndOfFile) // EndOfFile
}
```

#### Semantics of data objects

Since their first preview version in [Kotlin 1.7.20](whatsnew1720.md#improved-string-representations-for-singletons-and-sealed-class-hierarchies-with-data-objects),
the semantics of data objects have been refined. The compiler now automatically generates a number of convenience
functions for them:

##### toString

The `toString()` function of a data object returns the simple name of the object:

```kotlin
data object MyDataObject {
    val x: Int = 3
}

fun main() {
    println(MyDataObject) // MyDataObject
}
```

##### equals and hashCode

The `equals()` function for a `data object` ensures that all objects that have the type of your `data object` are
considered equal. In most cases, you will only have a single instance of your data object at runtime (after all,
a `data object` declares a singleton). However, in the edge case where another object of the same type is generated at
runtime (for example, via platform reflection through `java.lang.reflect`, or by using a JVM serialization library that
uses this API under the hood), this ensures that the objects are treated as equal.

Make sure to only compare `data objects` structurally (using the `==` operator) and never by reference (the `===`
operator). This helps avoid pitfalls when more than one instance of a data object exists at runtime. The following
snippet illustrates this specific edge case:

```kotlin
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor

data object MySingleton

fun main() {
    val evilTwin = createInstanceViaReflection()

    println(MySingleton) // MySingleton
    println(evilTwin) // MySingleton

    // Even when a library forcefully creates a second instance of MySingleton, its `equals` method returns true:
    println(MySingleton == evilTwin) // true

    // Do not compare data objects via ===.
    println(MySingleton === evilTwin) // false
}

fun createInstanceViaReflection(): MySingleton {
    // Kotlin reflection does not permit the instantiation of data objects.
    // This creates a new MySingleton instance "by force" (i.e., Java platform reflection)
    // Don't do this yourself!
    return (MySingleton.javaClass.declaredConstructors[0].apply { isAccessible = true } as Constructor<MySingleton>).newInstance()
}
```

The behavior of the generated `hashCode()` function is consistent with that of the `equals()` function, so that all
runtime instances of a `data object` have the same hash code.

##### No copy and componentN functions for data objects

While `data object` and `data class` declarations are often used together and have some similarities, there are some
functions that are not generated for a `data object`:

Because a `data object` declaration is intended to be used as a singleton object, no `copy()` function is generated.
The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance, and allowing copies of the instance to be
created would violate that restriction.

Also, unlike a `data class`, a `data object` does not have any data properties. Since attempting to destructure such an
object would not make sense, no `componentN()` functions are generated.

We would appreciate your feedback on this feature in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-4107).

#### How to enable the data objects preview

To try this feature out, enable the `-language-version 1.9` compiler option. In a Gradle project, you can do so by
adding the following to your `build.gradle(.kts)` file:

### Preview of lifting restriction on secondary constructors with bodies in inline classes

Kotlin 1.8.20 lifts restrictions on the use of secondary constructors with bodies
in [inline classes](inline-classes.md).

Inline classes used to allow only a public primary constructor without `init` blocks or secondary constructors to have
clear initialization semantics. As a result, it was impossible to encapsulate underlying values or create an inline
class that would represent some constrained values.

These issues were fixed when Kotlin 1.4.30 lifted restrictions on `init` blocks. Now we're taking it a step further and
allowing secondary constructors with bodies in preview mode:

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class Person(private val fullName: String) {
    // Allowed since Kotlin 1.4.30:
    init { 
        check(fullName.isNotBlank()) {
            "Full name shouldn't be empty"
        }
    }

    // Preview available since Kotlin 1.8.20:
    constructor(name: String, lastName: String) : this("$name $lastName") {
        check(lastName.isNotBlank()) {
            "Last name shouldn't be empty"
        }
    }
}
```

#### How to enable secondary constructors with bodies

To try this feature out, enable the `-language-version 1.9` compiler option. In a Gradle project, you can do so by
adding the following to your `build.gradle(.kts)`:

<tabs group="build-script">
<tab title="Kotlin" group-key="kotlin">

```kotlin
tasks
    .withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompilationTask<*>>()
    .configureEach {
        compilerOptions
            .languageVersion
            .set(
                org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
            )
    }
```

</tab>
<tab title="Groovy" group-key="groovy">

## New Kotlin/Wasm target

Kotlin/Wasm (Kotlin WebAssembly) goes [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained) in this
release. The Kotlin team finds [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to be a promising technology and wants to find
better ways for you to use it and get all of the benefits of Kotlin.

WebAssembly binary format is independent of the platform because it runs using its own virtual machine. Almost all modern
browsers already support WebAssembly 1.0. To set up the environment to run WebAssembly, you only need to enable an
experimental garbage collection mode that Kotlin/Wasm targets. You can find detailed instructions
here: [How to enable Kotlin/Wasm](#how-to-enable-kotlin-wasm).

We want to highlight the following advantages of the new Kotlin/Wasm target:

* Faster compilation speed compared to the `wasm32` Kotlin/Native target, since Kotlin/Wasm doesn't have to use LLVM.
* Easier interoperability with JS and integration with browsers compared to the `wasm32` target, thanks to the [Wasm garbage collection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc).
* Potentially faster application startup compared to Kotlin/JS and JavaScript because Wasm has a compact and
  easy-to-parse bytecode.
* Improved application runtime performance compared to Kotlin/JS and JavaScript because Wasm is a statically typed language.

Starting with the 1.8.20 release, you can use Kotlin/Wasm in your experimental projects.
We provide the Kotlin standard library (`stdlib`) and test library (`kotlin.test`) for Kotlin/Wasm out of the box.
IDE support will be added in future releases.

[Learn more about Kotlin/Wasm in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pqz9sKXatw).

### How to enable Kotlin/Wasm

To enable and test Kotlin/Wasm, update your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "1.8.20"
}

kotlin {
    wasm {
        binaries.executable()
        browser {
        }
    }
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting
        val commonTest by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(kotlin("test"))
            }
        }
        val wasmMain by getting
        val wasmTest by getting
    }
}
```

## Kotlin/JVM

Kotlin 1.8.20 introduces a [preview of Java synthetic property references](#preview-of-java-synthetic-property-references)
and [support for the JVM IR backend in the kapt stub generating task by default](#support-for-the-jvm-ir-backend-in-kapt-stub-generating-task-by-default).

### Preview of Java synthetic property references

{style="warning"}

Kotlin 1.8.20 introduces the ability to create references to Java synthetic properties, for example, for such Java code:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

Kotlin has always allowed you to write `person.age`, where `age` is a synthetic property.
Now, you can also create references to `Person::age` and `person::age`. All the same works for `name`, as well.

```kotlin
val persons = listOf(Person("Jack", 11), Person("Sofie", 12), Person("Peter", 11))
    persons
        // Call a reference to Java synthetic property:
        .sortedBy(Person::age)
        // Call Java getter via the Kotlin property syntax:
        .forEach { person -> println(person.name) }
```
{validate="false"}

#### How to enable Java synthetic property references

To try this feature out, enable the `-language-version 1.9` compiler option.
In a Gradle project, you can do so by adding the following to your `build.gradle(.kts)`:

### Support for the JVM IR backend in kapt stub generating task by default

In Kotlin 1.7.20, we introduced [support for the JVM IR backend in the kapt stub generating task](whatsnew1720.md#support-for-the-jvm-ir-backend-in-kapt-stub-generating-task). Starting with this release, this support works by default. You no longer need to specify `kapt.use.jvm.ir=true` in your `gradle.properties` to enable it.
We would appreciate your feedback on this feature in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-49682).

## Kotlin/Native

Kotlin 1.8.20 includes changes to supported Kotlin/Native targets, interoperability with Objective-C, and improvements to the CocoaPods Gradle plugin, among other updates:

* [Update for Kotlin/Native targets](#update-for-kotlin-native-targets)
* [Deprecation of the legacy memory manager](#deprecation-of-the-legacy-memory-manager)
* [Support for Objective-C headers with @import directives](#support-for-objective-c-headers-with-import-directives)
* [Support for link-only mode in the Cocoapods Gradle plugin](#support-for-the-link-only-mode-in-cocoapods-gradle-plugin)
* [Import Objective-C extensions as class members in UIKit](#import-objective-c-extensions-as-class-members-in-uikit)
* [Reimplementation of compiler cache management in the compiler](#reimplementation-of-compiler-cache-management-in-the-compiler)
* [Deprecation of `useLibraries()` in Cocoapods Gradle plugin](#deprecation-of-uselibraries-in-cocoapods-gradle-plugin)
  
### Update for Kotlin/Native targets
  
The Kotlin team decided to revisit the list of targets supported by Kotlin/Native, split them into tiers,
and deprecate some of them starting with Kotlin 1.8.20. See the [Kotlin/Native target support](native-target-support.md)
section for the full list of supported and deprecated targets.

The following targets have been deprecated with Kotlin 1.8.20 and will be removed in 1.9.20:

* `iosArm32`
* `watchosX86`
* `wasm32`
* `mingwX86`
* `linuxArm32Hfp`
* `linuxMips32`
* `linuxMipsel32`

As for the remaining targets, there are now three tiers of support depending on how well a target is supported and
tested in the Kotlin/Native compiler. A target can be moved to a different tier. For example, we'll do our best to
provide full support for `iosArm64` in the future, as it is important
for [Kotlin Multiplatform](multiplatform-get-started.md).

If you're a library author, these target tiers can help you decide which targets to test on CI tools and which ones to
skip. The Kotlin team will use the same approach when developing official Kotlin libraries,
like [kotlinx.coroutines](coroutines-guide.md).

Check out our [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2023/02/update-regarding-kotlin-native-targets/) to learn
more about the reasons for these changes.

### Deprecation of the legacy memory manager

Starting with 1.8.20, the legacy memory manager is deprecated and will be removed in 1.9.20.
The [new memory manager](native-memory-manager.md) was enabled by default in 1.7.20 and has been receiving further
stability updates and performance improvements.

If you're still using the legacy memory manager, remove the `kotlin.native.binary.memoryModel=strict` option from
your `gradle.properties` and follow our [Migration guide](native-migration-guide.md) to make the necessary changes.

The new memory manager doesn't support the `wasm32` target. This target is also
deprecated [starting with this release](#update-for-kotlin-native-targets) and will be removed in 1.9.20.

### Support for Objective-C headers with @import directives

> This feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).

{style="warning"}

Kotlin/Native can now import Objective-C headers with `@import` directives. This feature is useful for consuming Swift
libraries that have auto-generated Objective-C headers or classes of CocoaPods dependencies written in Swift.

Previously, the cinterop tool failed to analyze headers that depended on Objective-C modules via the `@import`
directive. The reason was that it lacked support for the `-fmodules` option.

Starting with Kotlin 1.8.20, you can use Objective-C headers with `@import`. To do so, pass the `-fmodules` option to
the compiler in the definition file as `compilerOpts`. If you use [CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md), specify
the cinterop option in the configuration block of the `pod()` function like this:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    ios()

    cocoapods {
        summary = "CocoaPods test library"
        homepage = "https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin"

        ios.deploymentTarget = "13.5"

        pod("PodName") {
            extraOpts = listOf("-compiler-option", "-fmodules")
        }
    }
}
```

This was a [highly awaited feature](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-39120), and we welcome your feedback about it in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue) to help us make it the default in future releases.

### Support for the link-only mode in Cocoapods Gradle plugin

With Kotlin 1.8.20, you can use Pod dependencies with dynamic frameworks only for linking,
without generating cinterop bindings. This may come in handy when cinterop bindings are already generated.

Consider a project with 2 modules, a library and an app. The library depends on a Pod but doesn't produce a framework,
only a `.klib`. The app depends on the library and produces a dynamic framework.
In this case, you need to link this framework with the Pods that the library depends on,
but you don't need cinterop bindings because they are already generated for the library.

To enable the feature, use the `linkOnly` option or a builder property when adding a dependency on a Pod:

```kotlin
cocoapods {
    summary = "CocoaPods test library"
    homepage = "https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin"

    pod("Alamofire", linkOnly = true) {
        version = "5.7.0"
    }
}
```

> If you use this option with static frameworks, it will remove the Pod dependency entirely because Pods are not used
> for static framework linking.

### Import Objective-C extensions as class members in UIKit

Since Xcode 14.1, some methods from Objective-C classes have been moved to category members. That led to the generation
of a different Kotlin API, and these methods were imported as Kotlin extensions instead of methods.

You may have experienced issues resulting from this when overriding methods using UIKit. For example, it became
impossible to override `drawRect()` or `layoutSubviews()` methods when subclassing a UIVIew in Kotlin.

Since 1.8.20, category members that are declared in the same headers as NSView and UIView classes are imported as
members of these classes. This means that the methods subclassing from NSView and UIView can be easily overridden, like
any other method.

If everything goes well, we're planning to enable this behavior by default for all of the Objective-C classes.

### Reimplementation of compiler cache management in the compiler

To speed up the evolution of compiler caches, we've moved compiler cache management from the Kotlin Gradle plugin to the
Kotlin/Native compiler. This unblocks work on several important improvements, including those to do with compilation
times and compiler cache flexibility.

If you encounter some problem and need to return to the old behavior, use the `kotlin.native.cacheOrchestration=gradle`
Gradle property.

We would appreciate your feedback on this [in YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).

### Deprecation of useLibraries() in Cocoapods Gradle plugin

Kotlin 1.8.20 starts the deprecation cycle of the `useLibraries()` function used in
the [CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md) for static libraries.

We introduced the `useLibraries()` function to allow dependencies on Pods containing static libraries. With time, this
case has become very rare. Most of the Pods are distributed by sources, and Objective-C frameworks or XCFrameworks are a
common choice for binary distribution.

Since this function is unpopular and it creates issues that complicate the development of the Kotlin CocoaPods Gradle
plugin, we've decided to deprecate it.

For more information on frameworks and XCFrameworks, see [Build final native binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md).

## Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin 1.8.20 strives to improve the developer experience with the following updates to Kotlin Multiplatform:

* [New approach for setting up source set hierarchy](#new-approach-to-source-set-hierarchy)
* [Preview of Gradle composite builds support in Kotlin Multiplatform](#preview-of-gradle-composite-builds-support-in-kotlin-multiplatform)
* [Improved output for Gradle errors in Xcode](#improved-output-for-gradle-errors-in-xcode)

### New approach to source set hierarchy

> The new approach to source set hierarchy is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> It may be changed in future Kotlin releases without prior notice. Opt-in is required (see the details below).
> We would appreciate your feedback in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue).
>
{style="warning"}

Kotlin 1.8.20 offers a new way of setting up source set hierarchy in your multiplatform projects âˆ’ the default target
hierarchy. The new approach is intended to replace target shortcuts like `ios`, which have their [design flaws](#why-replace-shortcuts).

The idea behind the default target hierarchy is simple: You explicitly declare all the targets to which your project
compiles, and the Kotlin Gradle plugin automatically creates shared source sets based on the specified targets.

#### Set up your project

Consider this example of a simple multiplatform mobile app:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)
kotlin {
    // Enable the default target hierarchy:
    targetHierarchy.default()

    android()
    iosArm64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()
}
```

You can think of the default target hierarchy as a template for all possible targets and their shared source sets. When
you declare the final targets `android`, `iosArm64`, and `iosSimulatorArm64` in your code, the Kotlin Gradle plugin
finds suitable shared source sets from the template and creates them for you. The resulting hierarchy looks like this:

![An example of using the default target hierarchy](default-hierarchy-example.svg){thumbnail="true" width="350" thumbnail-same-file="true"}

Green source sets are actually created and present in the project, while gray ones from the default template are
ignored. As you can see, the Kotlin Gradle plugin hasn't created the `watchos` source set, for example, because there
are no watchOS targets in the project.

If you add a watchOS target, such as `watchosArm64`, the `watchos` source set is created, and the code from
the `apple`, `native`, and `common` source sets is compiled to `watchosArm64`, as well.

You can find the complete scheme for the default target hierarchy in the [documentation](multiplatform-hierarchy.md#default-hierarchy-template).

> In this example, the `apple` and `native` source sets compile only to the `iosArm64` and `iosSimulatorArm64` targets.
> Therefore, despite their names, they have access to the full iOS API.
> This might be counter-intuitive for source sets like `native`, as you may expect that only APIs available on all
> native targets are accessible in this source set. This behavior may change in the future.
>
{style="note"}

#### Why replace shortcuts {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

Creating source sets hierarchies can be verbose, error-prone, and unfriendly for beginners. Our previous solution was to
introduce shortcuts like `ios` that create a part of the hierarchy for you. However, working with shortcuts proved they
have a big design flaw: they're difficult to change.

Take the `ios` shortcut, for example. It creates only the `iosArm64` and `iosX64` targets, which can be confusing and
may lead to issues when working on an M1-based host that requires the `iosSimulatorArm64` target as well. However,
adding the `iosSimulatorArm64` target can be a very disruptive change for user projects:

* All dependencies used in the `iosMain` source set have to support the `iosSimulatorArm64` target; otherwise, the
  dependency resolution fails.
* Some native APIs used in `iosMain` may disappear when adding a new target (though this is unlikely in the case
  of `iosSimulatorArm64`).
* In some cases, such as when writing a small pet project on your Intel-based MacBook, you might not even need this
  change.

It became clear that shortcuts didn't solve the problem of configuring hierarchies, which is why we stopped adding new
shortcuts at some point.

The default target hierarchy may look similar to shortcuts at first glance, but they have a crucial distinction: **users
have to explicitly specify the set of targets**. This set defines how your project is compiled and published and how it
participates in dependency resolution. Since this set is fixed, changes to the default configuration from the Kotlin
Gradle plugin should cause significantly less distress in the ecosystem, and it will be much easier to provide
tooling-assisted migration.

#### How to enable the default hierarchy

This new feature is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). For Kotlin Gradle build scripts,
you need to opt in with `@OptIn(ExperimentalKotlinGradlePluginApi::class)`.

For more information, see [Hierarchical project structure](multiplatform-hierarchy.md#default-hierarchy-template).

#### Leave feedback

This is a significant change to multiplatform projects. We would appreciate your [feedback](https://kotl.in/issue) to
help make it even better.

### Preview of Gradle composite builds support in Kotlin Multiplatform

> This feature has been supported in Gradle builds since Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.8.20. For IDE support, use IntelliJ IDEA
> 2023.1 Beta 2 (231.8109.2) or later and the Kotlin Gradle plugin 1.8.20 with any Kotlin IDE plugin.
>
{style="note"}

Starting with 1.8.20, Kotlin Multiplatform supports [Gradle composite builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html).
Composite builds allow you to include builds of separate projects or parts of the same project into a single build.

Due to some technical challenges, using Gradle composite builds with Kotlin Multiplatform was only partially supported.
Kotlin 1.8.20 contains a preview of the improved support that should work with a larger variety of projects.
To try it out, add the following option to your `gradle.properties`:

```none
kotlin.mpp.import.enableKgpDependencyResolution=true
```

This option enables a preview of the new import mode. Besides the support for composite builds, it provides a smoother
import experience in multiplatform projects, as we've included major bug fixes and improvements to make the import more
stable.

#### Known issues

It's still a preview version that needs further stabilization, and you might encounter some issues with import along the
way. Here are some known issues we're planning to fix before the final release of Kotlin 1.8.20:

* There's no Kotlin 1.8.20 plugin available for IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1 EAP yet. Despite that, you can still set the Kotlin
  Gradle plugin version to 1.8.20 and try out composite builds in this IDE.
* If your projects include builds with a specified `rootProject.name`, composite builds may fail to resolve the Kotlin metadata.
  For the workaround and details, see this [Youtrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-56536).

We encourage you to try it out and submit all reports on [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue) to help us make it the
default in Kotlin 1.9.0.

### Improved output for Gradle errors in Xcode

If you had issues building your multiplatform projects in Xcode, you might have encountered a "Command
PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" error.
This message signals that the Gradle invocation has failed, but it's not very helpful when trying to detect the problem.

Starting with Kotlin 1.8.20, Xcode can parse the output from the Kotlin/Native compiler. Furthermore, in case the
Gradle build fails, you'll see an additional error message from the root cause exception in Xcode. In most cases,
it'll help to identify the root problem.

![Improved output for Gradle errors in Xcode](xcode-gradle-output.png){width=700}

The new behavior is enabled by default for the standard Gradle tasks for Xcode integration,
like `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` that can connect the iOS framework from your multiplatform project to the iOS
application in Xcode. It can also be enabled (or disabled) with the `kotlin.native.useXcodeMessageStyle` Gradle property.

## Kotlin/JavaScript

Kotlin 1.8.20 changes the ways TypeScript definitions can be generated. It also includes a change designed to improve
your debugging experience:

* [Removal of Dukat integration from the Gradle plugin](#removal-of-dukat-integration-from-gradle-plugin)
* [Kotlin variable and function names in source maps](#kotlin-variable-and-function-names-in-source-maps)
* [Opt in for generation of TypeScript definition files](#opt-in-for-generation-of-typescript-definition-files)

### Removal of Dukat integration from Gradle plugin

In Kotlin 1.8.20, we've removed our [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained) Dukat
integration from the Kotlin/JavaScript Gradle plugin. The Dukat integration supported the automatic conversion of
TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) into Kotlin external declarations.

You can still convert TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) into Kotlin external declarations by using
our [Dukat tool](https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat) instead.

> The Dukat tool is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> It may be dropped or changed at any time.
>
{style="warning"}

### Kotlin variable and function names in source maps

To help with debugging, we've introduced the ability to add the names that you declared in Kotlin code for variables and
functions into your source maps. Prior to 1.8.20, these weren't available in source maps, so in the debugger, you always
saw the variable and function names of the generated JavaScript.

You can configure what is added by using `sourceMapNamesPolicy` in your Gradle file `build.gradle.kts`, or
the `-source-map-names-policy` compiler option. The table below lists the possible settings:

| Setting                 | Description                                                   | Example output                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `simple-names`          | Variable names and simple function names are added. (Default) | `main`                            |
| `fully-qualified-names` | Variable names and fully qualified function names are added.  | `com.example.kjs.playground.main` |
| `no`                    | No variable or function names are added.                      | N/A                               |

See below for an example configuration in a `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.Kotlin2JsCompile>().configureEach {
    compilercompileOptions.sourceMapNamesPolicy.set(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JsSourceMapNamesPolicy.SOURCE_MAP_NAMES_POLICY_FQ_NAMES) // or SOURCE_MAP_NAMES_POLICY_NO, or SOURCE_MAP_NAMES_POLICY_SIMPLE_NAMES
}
```
{validate="false"}

Debugging tools like those provided in Chromium-based browsers can pick up the original Kotlin names from your source
map to improve the readability of your stack trace. Happy debugging!

> The addition of variable and function names in source maps is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> It may be dropped or changed at any time.
>
{style="warning"}

### Opt in for generation of TypeScript definition files

Previously, if you had a project that produced executable files (`binaries.executable()`), the Kotlin/JS IR compiler
collected any top-level declarations marked with `@JsExport` and automatically generated TypeScript definitions in
a `.d.ts` file.

As this isn't useful for every project, we've changed the behavior in Kotlin 1.8.20. If you want to generate TypeScript
definitions, you have to explicitly configure this in your Gradle build file. Add `generateTypeScriptDefinitions()` to
your `build.gradle.kts.file` in the [`js` section](js-project-setup.md#execution-environments). For example:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    js {
        binaries.executable()
        browser {
        }
        generateTypeScriptDefinitions()
    }
}
```
{validate="false"}

> The generation of TypeScript definitions (`d.ts`)
> is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). It may be dropped or changed at any time.

{style="warning"}

## Gradle

Kotlin 1.8.20 is fully compatible with Gradle 6.8 through 7.6 except for some [special cases in the Multiplatform plugin](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-55751).
You can also use Gradle versions up to the latest Gradle release, but if you do,
keep in mind that you might encounter deprecation warnings or some new Gradle features might not work.

This version brings the following changes:

* [New alignment of Gradle plugins' versions](#new-gradle-plugins-versions-alignment)
* [New JVM incremental compilation by default in Gradle](#new-jvm-incremental-compilation-by-default-in-gradle)
* [Precise backup of compilation tasks' outputs](#precise-backup-of-compilation-tasks-outputs)
* [Lazy Kotlin/JVM task creation for all Gradle versions](#lazy-kotlin-jvm-tasks-creation-for-all-gradle-versions)
* [Non-default location of compile tasks' destinationDirectory](#non-default-location-of-compile-tasks-destinationdirectory)
* [Ability to opt-out from reporting compiler arguments to an HTTP statistics service](#ability-to-opt-out-from-reporting-compiler-arguments-to-an-http-statistics-service)

### New Gradle plugins versions alignment

Gradle provides a way to ensure dependencies that must work together are always [aligned in their versions](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_version_alignment.html#aligning_versions_natively_with_gradle).
Kotlin 1.8.20 adopted this approach, too. It works by default so that you don't need to change or update your
configuration to enable it. In addition, you no longer need to resort to [this workaround for resolving Kotlin Gradle plugins' transitive dependencies](whatsnew18.md#resolution-of-kotlin-gradle-plugins-transitive-dependencies).

We would appreciate your feedback on this feature in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-54691).

### New JVM incremental compilation by default in Gradle

The new approach to incremental compilation, which [has been available since Kotlin 1.7.0](whatsnew17.md#a-new-approach-to-incremental-compilation),
now works by default. You no longer need to specify `kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=true` in your `gradle.properties` to
enable it.

We would appreciate your feedback on this. You can [file an issue](https://kotl.in/issue) in YouTrack.

### Precise backup of compilation tasks' outputs

> Precise backup of compilation tasks' outputs is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained).
> To use it, add `kotlin.compiler.preciseCompilationResultsBackup=true` to `gradle.properties`.
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue/experimental-ic-optimizations).
>
{style="warning"}

Starting with Kotlin 1.8.20, you can enable precise backup, whereby only those classes that Kotlin recompiles in
the [incremental compilation](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#incremental-compilation) will be backed up.
Both full and precise backups help to run builds incrementally again after compilation errors. Precise backup also saves
build time compared to full backup. Full backup may take **noticeable** build time in large projects or if many tasks are
making backups, especially if a project is located on a slow HDD.

This optimization is Experimental. You can enable it by adding the `kotlin.compiler.preciseCompilationResultsBackup`
Gradle property to the `gradle.properties` file:

```none
kotlin.compiler.preciseCompilationResultsBackup=true
```

#### Example of precise backup usage in JetBrains {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

In the following charts, you can see examples of using precise backup compared to full backup:

![Comparison of full and precise backups](comparison-of-full-and-precise-backups.png){width=700}

The first and second charts show how precise backup in the Kotlin project affects building the Kotlin Gradle plugin:

1. After making a small [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) change â€“ adding a new public
   method â€“ to a module that lots of modules depend on.
2. After making a small non-ABI change â€“ adding a private function â€“ to a module that no other modules depend on.

The third chart shows how precise backup in the [Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/) project affects building a web
frontend after a small non-ABI change â€“ adding a private function â€“ to a Kotlin/JS module that lots of modules depend
on.

These measurements were performed on a computer with the Apple M1 Max CPU; different computers will yield slightly
different results. The factors affecting performance include but are not limited to:

* How warm the [Kotlin daemon](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#the-kotlin-daemon-and-how-to-use-it-with-gradle) and
  the [Gradle daemon](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html) are.
* How fast or slow the disk is.
* The CPU model and how busy it is.
* Which modules are affected by the changes and how big these modules are.
* Whether the changes are ABI or non-ABI.

#### Evaluating optimizations with build reports {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

To estimate the impact of the optimization on your computer for your project and your scenarios,
you can use [Kotlin build reports](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#build-reports).
Enable reports in the text file format by adding the following property to your `gradle.properties` file:

```none
kotlin.build.report.output=file
```

Here is an example of a relevant part of the report before enabling precise backup:

```none
Task ':kotlin-gradle-plugin:compileCommonKotlin' finished in 0.59 s
<...>
Time metrics:
 Total Gradle task time: 0.59 s
 Task action before worker execution: 0.24 s
  Backup output: 0.22 s // Pay attention to this number 
<...>
```

And here is an example of a relevant part of the report after enabling precise backup:

```none
Task ':kotlin-gradle-plugin:compileCommonKotlin' finished in 0.46 s
<...>
Time metrics:
 Total Gradle task time: 0.46 s
 Task action before worker execution: 0.07 s
  Backup output: 0.05 s // The time has reduced
 Run compilation in Gradle worker: 0.32 s
  Clear jar cache: 0.00 s
  Precise backup output: 0.00 s // Related to precise backup
  Cleaning up the backup stash: 0.00 s // Related to precise backup
<...>
```

### Lazy Kotlin/JVM tasks creation for all Gradle versions

For projects with the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.jvm` plugin on Gradle 7.3+, the Kotlin Gradle plugin no longer
creates and configures the task `compileKotlin` eagerly. On lower Gradle versions, it simply registers all the tasks and
doesn't configure them on a dry run. The same behavior is now in place when using Gradle 7.3+.

### Non-default location of compile tasks' destinationDirectory

Update your build script with some additional code if you do one of the following:

* Override the Kotlin/JVM `KotlinJvmCompile`/`KotlinCompile` task's `destinationDirectory` location.
* Use a deprecated Kotlin/JS/Non-IR [variant](gradle-plugin-variants.md) and override the `Kotlin2JsCompile`
  task's `destinationDirectory`.

You need to explicitly add `sourceSets.main.kotlin.classesDirectories` to `sourceSets.main.outputs` in your JAR file:

```groovy
tasks.jar(type: Jar) {
    from sourceSets.main.outputs
    from sourceSets.main.kotlin.classesDirectories
}
```

### Ability to opt-out from reporting compiler arguments to an HTTP statistics service

You can now control whether the Kotlin Gradle plugin should include compiler arguments in HTTP [build reports](gradle-compilation-and-caches.md#build-reports).
Sometimes, you might not need the plugin to report these arguments.  If a project contains many modules,
its compiler arguments in the report can be very heavy and not that helpful. There is now a way to disable it and thus save memory.
In your `gradle.properties` or `local.properties`, use the `kotlin.build.report.include_compiler_arguments=(true|false)` property.

We would appreciate your feedback on this feature on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-55323/).

## Standard library

Kotlin 1.8.20 adds a variety of new features, including some that are particularly useful for Kotlin/Native development:

* [Support for the AutoCloseable interface](#support-for-the-autocloseable-interface)
* [Support for Base64 encoding and decoding](#support-for-base64-encoding)
* [Support for @Volatile in Kotlin/Native](#support-for-volatile-in-kotlin-native)
* [Bug fix for stack overflow when using regex in Kotlin/Native](#bug-fix-for-stack-overflow-when-using-regex-in-kotlin-native)

### Support for the AutoCloseable interface

> The new `AutoCloseable` interface is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained), and to use it
> you need to opt in with `@OptIn(ExperimentalStdlibApi::class)` or the compiler argument `-opt-in=kotlin.ExperimentalStdlibApi`.
>

{style="warning"}

The `AutoCloseable` interface has been added to the common standard library so that you can use one common interface for
all libraries to close resources. In Kotlin/JVM, the `AutoCloseable` interface is an alias
for [`java.lang.AutoClosable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html).

In addition, the extension function `use()` is now included, which executes a given block function on the selected
resource and then closes it down correctly, whether an exception is thrown or not.

There is no public class in the common standard library that implements the `AutoCloseable` interface. In the example
below, we define the `XMLWriter` interface and assume that there is a resource that implements it. For example, this
resource could be a class that opens a file, writes XML content, and then closes it.

```kotlin
interface XMLWriter : AutoCloseable {
    fun document(encoding: String, version: String, content: XMLWriter.() -> Unit)
    fun element(name: String, content: XMLWriter.() -> Unit)
    fun attribute(name: String, value: String)
    fun text(value: String)
}

fun writeBooksTo(writer: XMLWriter) {
    writer.use { xml ->
        xml.document(encoding = "UTF-8", version = "1.0") {
            element("bookstore") {
                element("book") {
                    attribute("category", "fiction")
                    element("title") { text("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban") }
                    element("author") { text("J. K. Rowling") }
                    element("year") { text("1999") }
                    element("price") { text("29.99") }
                }
                element("book") {
                    attribute("category", "programming")
                    element("title") { text("Kotlin in Action") }
                    element("author") { text("Dmitry Jemerov") }
                    element("author") { text("Svetlana Isakova") }
                    element("year") { text("2017") }
                    element("price") { text("25.19") }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{validate="false"}

### Support for Base64 encoding

> The new encoding and decoding functionality is [Experimental](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained),
> and to use it, you need to opt in with `@OptIn(ExperimentalEncodingApi::class)` or the
> compiler argument `-opt-in=kotlin.io.encoding.ExperimentalEncodingApi`.
>
{style="warning"}

We've added support for Base64 encoding and decoding. We provide 3 class instances, each using different encoding
schemes and displaying different behaviors. Use the `Base64.Default` instance for the standard [Base64 encoding scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-4).

Use the `Base64.UrlSafe` instance for the ["URL and Filename safe"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-5)
encoding scheme.

Use the `Base64.Mime` instance for the [MIME](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045#section-6.8) encoding scheme. When
you use the `Base64.Mime` instance, all encoding functions insert a line separator every 76 characters. In the case of
decoding, any illegal characters are skipped and don't throw an exception.

> The `Base64.Default` instance is the companion object of the `Base64` class. As a result, you can call its functions
> via `Base64.encode()` and  `Base64.decode()` instead of `Base64.Default.encode()` and `Base64.Default.decode()`.
>
{style="tip"}

```kotlin
val foBytes = "fo".map { it.code.toByte() }.toByteArray()
Base64.Default.encode(foBytes) // "Zm8="
// Alternatively:
// Base64.encode(foBytes)

val foobarBytes = "foobar".map { it.code.toByte() }.toByteArray()
Base64.UrlSafe.encode(foobarBytes) // "Zm9vYmFy"

Base64.Default.decode("Zm8=") // foBytes
// Alternatively:
// Base64.decode("Zm8=")

Base64.UrlSafe.decode("Zm9vYmFy") // foobarBytes
```
{validate="false"}

You can use additional functions to encode or decode bytes into an existing buffer, as well as to append the encoding
result to a provided `Appendable` type object.

In Kotlin/JVM, we've also added the extension functions `encodingWith()` and `decodingWith()` to enable you to perform
Base64 encoding and decoding with input and output streams.

### Support for @Volatile in Kotlin/Native

If you annotate a `var` property with `@Volatile`, then the backing field is marked so that any reads or writes to this
field are atomic, and writes are always made visible to other threads.

Prior to 1.8.20, the [`kotlin.jvm.Volatile` annotation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.jvm/-volatile/)
was available in the common standard library. However, this annotation is only effective in the JVM.
If you use it in Kotlin/Native, it is ignored, which can lead to errors.

In 1.8.20, we've introduced a common annotation, `kotlin.concurrent.Volatile`, that you can use in both the JVM and
Kotlin/Native.

#### How to enable

To try this feature out, opt in with `@OptIn(ExperimentalStdlibApi)` and enable the `-language-version 1.9` compiler
option. In a Gradle project, you can do so by adding the following to your `build.gradle(.kts)` file:

<tabs group="build-script">
<tab title="Kotlin" group-key="kotlin">

```kotlin
tasks
    .withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompilationTask<*>>()
    .configureEach {
        compilerOptions
            .languageVersion
            .set(
                org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
            )
    }
```

</tab>
<tab title="Groovy" group-key="groovy">

```groovy
tasks
    .withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompilationTask.class)
    .configureEach {
        compilerOptions.languageVersion =
            org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
    }
```

</tab>
</tabs>

### Bug fix for stack overflow when using regex in Kotlin/Native

In previous versions of Kotlin, a crash could occur if your regex input contained a large number of characters,
even when the regex pattern was very simple. In 1.8.20, this issue has been resolved.
For more information, see [KT-46211](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-46211).

## Serialization updates

Kotlin 1.8.20 comes with [Alpha support for the Kotlin K2 compiler](#prototype-serialization-compiler-plugin-for-kotlin-k2-compiler)
and [prohibits serializer customization via companion object](#prohibit-implicit-serializer-customization-via-companion-object).

### Prototype serialization compiler plugin for Kotlin K2 compiler

> Support for the serialization compiler plugin for K2 is in
> [Alpha](components-stability.md#stability-levels-explained). To use it,

Starting with 1.8.20, the serialization compiler plugin works with the Kotlin K2 compiler.
Give it a try and [share your feedback with us](#leave-your-feedback-on-the-new-k2-compiler)!

### Prohibit implicit serializer customization via companion object

Currently, it is possible to declare a class as serializable with the `@Serializable` annotation and, at the same time,
declare a custom serializer with the `@Serializer` annotation on its companion object.

For example:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*

@Serializable
class Foo(val a: Int) {
    @Serializer(Foo::class)
    companion object {
        // Custom implementation of KSerializer<Foo>
    }
}
```

In this case, it's not clear from the `@Serializable` annotation which serializer is used. In actual fact, class `Foo`
has a custom serializer.

To prevent this kind of confusion, in Kotlin 1.8.20 we've introduced a compiler warning for when this scenario is
detected. The warning includes a possible migration path to resolve this issue.

If you use such constructs in your code, we recommend updating them to the below:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*

@Serializable(Foo.Companion::class)
class Foo(val a: Int) {
    // Doesn't matter if you use @Serializer(Foo::class) or not
    companion object: KSerializer<Foo> {
        // Custom implementation of KSerializer<Foo>
    }
}
```

With this approach, it is clear that the `Foo` class uses the custom serializer declared in the companion object. For
more information, see our [YouTrack ticket](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-54441).

> In Kotlin 2.0, we plan to promote the compile warning to a compiler error. We recommend
> that you migrate your code if you see this warning.

## Documentation updates

The Kotlin documentation has received some notable changes:

* [Get started with Spring Boot and Kotlin](jvm-get-started-spring-boot.md) â€“ create a simple application with a
  database and learn more about the features of Spring Boot and Kotlin.
* [Scope functions](scope-functions.md) â€“ learn how to simplify your code with useful scope functions from the standard
  library.
* [CocoaPods integration](native-cocoapods.md) â€“ set up an environment to work with CocoaPods.

## Install Kotlin 1.8.20

### Check the IDE version

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) 2022.2 and 2022.3 automatically suggest updating the Kotlin
plugin to version 1.8.20. IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1 has the built-in Kotlin plugin 1.8.20.

Android Studio Flamingo (222) and Giraffe (223) will support Kotlin 1.8.20 in the next releases.

The new command-line compiler is available for download on
the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.8.20).

### Configure Gradle settings

To download Kotlin artifacts and dependencies properly, update your `settings.gradle(.kts)` file
to use the Maven Central repository:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

If the repository is not specified, Gradle uses the sunset JCenter repository that could lead to issues with Kotlin artifacts.
