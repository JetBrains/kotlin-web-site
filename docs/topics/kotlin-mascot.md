### Movements

The mascot is dynamic, positive, and adventurous, which generally makes its movements nimble, quick, and sharp.
Keep this in mind when creating animations and dynamic compositions.

### Styles

There are two styles for our mascot – 2D and 3D. The vector mascot is generally used with a 3D background,
while a 3D mascot is used on a flat background.
