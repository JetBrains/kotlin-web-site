## Kotlin contributor guidelines for Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

### Getting started

1. Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and the [program announcement](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

2. Familiarize yourself with the Kotlin language:
    * The official [Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a great place to start.
    * Read the official [documentation](getting-started.md) to get a better understanding of the language.
    * Take a look at the Kotlin courses on [JetBrains Academy](https://lp.jetbrains.com/academy/learn-kotlin/) or the Android team's [Training options](https://developer.android.com/courses/).
    * Follow the [Kotlin X](https://twitter.com/kotlin) or [Kotlin Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kotlinlang.org) accounts to stay up to date on the latest news and developments.
    * Check out the [Kotlin YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin) for tutorials, tips, and the latest updates.

3. Get to know the Kotlin open source community:
    * Explore the general [Kotlin contribution guidelines](contribute.md).
    * [Join the Kotlin Slack channel](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up) to connect with other developers and get help with any questions you may have.
    * [Join the #gsoc channel](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/gsoc) to ask questions and get support from the GSoC team.

### How to apply

1. Check out the [project ideas](#project-ideas) and select the one you would like to work on.
2. If you are not familiar with Kotlin, [read the introductory info on the Kotlin website](getting-started.md).
3. Refer to the [GSoC contributor guidelines](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).
4. Apply via the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
    * We suggest that you write a working code sample relevant to the proposed project. You can also show us any code sample that you are particularly proud of.
    * Describe why you are interested in Kotlin and your experience with it.
    * If you participate in open source projects, please reference your contribution history.
    * If you have a GitHub, Twitter account, blog, or portfolio of technical or scientific publications, please reference them as well.
    * Disclose any conflicts with the GSoC timeline due to other commitments, such as exams and vacations.

Thank you! We look forward to reading your applications!

## Project ideas

### Kotlin Compiler Fuzzer (Kai) [Hard, 350 hrs]

In recent years, fuzzing has become a widely used technique for finding complex bugs in software.
The Kotlin compiler is no exception: previous fuzzing efforts resulted in more than 200 deduplicated bugs across different compiler subsystems.

However, the existing fuzzer implementation is now obsolete and cannot be reasonably evolved further.
The goal of this project is to build a new Kotlin compiler fuzzer, **Kai**, from scratch,
based on previous experience and modern tools and techniques.

The main goal of this internship is to establish a solid foundation for future development of the fuzzer.
The focus areas include:

* Designing a fuzzer architecture that supports pluggability
* Selecting tools for generating, mutating, and processing Kotlin code
* Defining reliable ways to detect compiler failures
* Designing proper workflows for collecting, classifying, and handling discovered issues

As a deliverable, we aim to create a prototype Kotlin compiler fuzzer that is modular and easy to evolve,
unlike a monolithic implementation. Finding real compiler bugs would be a great bonus,
but it is not the primary goal of this internship.

If you have preliminary questions about the project, contact the mentor at: marat.akhin [at] jetbrains.com

**Expected outcomes**

A prototype Kotlin compiler fuzzer with a pluggable architecture that supports future evolution.

**Skills required (must-have)**

* Proficiency in Kotlin or another JVM-based language
* Technical English sufficient for reading relevant papers and documentation
* Basic understanding of compilers

**Skills required (nice-to-have)**

* Familiarity with fuzzing or other forms of program analysis
* Experience with Kotlin compiler plugins, IDE plugins, or other pluggable systems
* Experience with greenfield developer tooling projects

**What you will learn**

* Hands-on experience with compiler fuzzing
* How internal developer tooling is designed and built
* How to design and implement pluggable systems

**Possible mentor**

Marat Akhin, JetBrains

**This project includes a test task. Please email education@kotlinlang.org to receive the details.**

### Swift-to-Kotlin interop (PoC) [Hard, 350 hrs]

Modern software projects rarely live in a single language ecosystem. On Apple platforms, Swift is the primary language,
while Kotlin is widely used for shared and cross-platform business logic.
However, there is currently no straightforward way to import Swift APIs directly into Kotlin.

In this project, you will build on an existing open-source Swift–Java bridge and add Kotlin/Native as a target runtime.
This includes designing how Swift APIs are exposed to Kotlin/Native, how calls cross the Swift/Kotlin boundary,
and how object lifetimes are managed across runtimes.

The goal is to create a proof of concept for Swift-to-Kotlin/Native interop, document design decisions and trade-offs,
and evaluate limitations and future directions.

**Expected outcomes**

A proof of concept for Swift-to-Kotlin/Native interop, with documented design decisions, trade-offs, limitations,
and future directions.

**Skills required (must-have)**

* Currently pursuing or recently completed a degree in Computer Science or a related field
* Familiarity with Swift
* Interest in programming languages and interoperability

**Skills required (nice-to-have)**

* Familiarity with Kotlin

**Possible mentor**

Artem Olkov, JetBrains

### Tail call support in the Kotlin/Wasm backend [Medium, 90 hrs]

This project focuses on integrating the tail call proposal into the Kotlin/Wasm backend.
The intern will design and implement tail call support and evaluate its impact through benchmarking.

**Expected outcomes**

Design and implementation of tail call support for Kotlin/Wasm, with benchmarks and evaluation.

**Skills required (preferred)**

General familiarity with interpreters and compilers, and interest in optimization and benchmarking.

**Possible mentor**

Charlie Zhang, JetBrains

### Kotlin Education landscape report [Medium, 175 hrs]

Kotlin is taught and used in educational settings worldwide.
This project aims to create a structured, up-to-date overview of where and how Kotlin is taught.

**Expected outcomes**

* A “Kotlin in Education” report highlighting trends and gaps
* Reusable datasets for internal and public use
* Input for future strategy

**Skills required (preferred)**

* Research and data analysis skills
* Interest in programming education and developer ecosystems

**Possible mentor**

Ksenia Shneyveys, JetBrains
