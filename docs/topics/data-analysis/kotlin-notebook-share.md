[//]: # (title: Share your Kotlin Notebook)

To share a [Kotlin Notebook](kotlin-notebook-overview.md), you can just upload it to any notebook web viewer because [Kotlin notebooks](data-analysis-overview.md#notebooks) follow the 
universal Jupyter format.

We recommend the following platforms to share Kotlin notebooks:

* **JetBrains Datalore:** This platform not only facilitates the sharing of Kotlin notebooks but also improves their usability.
  [Datalore](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/) allows you to execute and edit notebooks, and incorporates advanced features, such as creating interactive
  reports and scheduling notebook runs. To see it in action, see [Kotlin Datalore example using DataFrame](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/report/static/KQKedA4jDrKu63O53gEN0z/B5YeMMONSAR78FgKQ9yJyW).

* **GitHub**: GitHub natively renders Kotlin notebooks, allowing for straightforward sharing and collaboration.
  For an example, see the [Examples of Kotlin DataFrame GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/blob/master/examples/notebooks/titanic/Titanic.ipynb).
