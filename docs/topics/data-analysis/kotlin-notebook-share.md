Now that you have created your first Kotlin notebook, you are ready to share your work with others! 

## Share a Kotlin notebook

To share a Kotlin notebook, you can simply upload it to any notebook web viewer, since Kotlin notebooks adhere to the 
universal Jupyter format.

One effective platform is [JetBrains Datalore](https://datalore.jetbrains.com). 
This platform not only facilitates the sharing of Kotlin notebooks but also enhances their usability.
Datalore allows you to execute and edit notebooks, and incorporates advanced features like the creation of interactive 
reports and the option to schedule notebook runs. To see it in action, see [Kotlin Datalore example using DataFrame](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/report/static/KQKedA4jDrKu63O53gEN0z/xSJ4rx49hcH71pPnFgZBCq).

GitHub is another great option. It natively renders Kotlin notebooks, allowing for straightforward sharing and collaboration.
For an example, see the [Examples of Kotlin DataFrame GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/blob/master/examples/notebooks/titanic/Titanic.ipynb).
