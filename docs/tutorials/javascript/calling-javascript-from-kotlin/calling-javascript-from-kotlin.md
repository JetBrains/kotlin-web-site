* [Use Standard Library Function to emit JavaScript](#usingstandardlibraryfunctions)
* [Work with strongly-typed libraries](#workingwithstronglytypedlibraries)
* [Create mappings with Dynamic and Native](#creatingmappingswithdynamicandnative)

## Using Standard Library Functions

Give the following code
