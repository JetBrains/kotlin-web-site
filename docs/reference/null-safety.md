# Null Safety

## Nullable types and Non-Null Types

Kotlin's type system is aimed at eliminating null references from code, also known as the [The Billion Dollar Mistake](http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+References:+The+Billion+Dollar+Mistake)

One of the most common pitfalls in many programming languages, including Java is that of accessing a member of a null references, resulting in null reference exceptions. In Java this
would be the equivalent of a `NullPointerException` or NPE for short.

Kotlin's type system is aimed to eliminate `NullPointerException`'s from our code. The only possible causes of NPE's may be

* An explicit call to `throw NullPointerException()`
* External Java code has caused it
* There's some data inconsistency with regard to initialization (an uninitialized *this* available in a constructor is used somewhere)

In Kotlin the type system distinguishes between references that can hold *null*{: .keyword } (nullable references) and those that can not (non-null references).
For example, a regular variable of type `String` can not hold *null*{: .keyword }:

``` kotlin
var a: String = "abc"
a = null // compilation error
```

To allow nulls, we can declare a variable as nullable string, written `String?`:

``` kotlin
var b: String? = "abc"
b = null // ok
```

Now, if you call a method on `a`, it's guaranteed not to cause an NPE, so you can safely say

``` kotlin
val l = a.length()
```

But if you want to call the same method on `b`, that would not be safe, and the compiler reports an error:

``` kotlin
val l = b.length() // error: variable 'b' can be null
```

But we still need to call that method, right? There are a few ways of doing that.

## Checking for *null*{: .keyword } in conditions

First, you can explicitly check if `b` is *null*{: .keyword }, and handle the two options separately:

``` kotlin
val l = if (b != null) b.length() else -1
```

The compiler tracks the information about the check you performed, and allows the call to `length()` inside the *if*{: .keyword }.
More complex conditions are supported as well:

``` kotlin
if (b != null && b.length() > 0)
  print("String of length ${b.length()}")
else
  print("Empty string")
```

Note that this only works where `b` is immutable (i.e. a local *val*{: .keyword } or a member *val*{: .keyword }
which has a backing field and is not overridable), because otherwise it might happen that `b` changes to *null*{: .keyword } after the check.

## Safe Calls

Your second option is the safe call operator, written `?.`:

``` kotlin
b?.length()
```
This returns `b.length()` if `b` is not null, and *null*{: .keyword } otherwise. The type of this expression is `Int?`.

Safe calls are useful in chains. For example, if Bob, an Employee, may be assigned to a Department (or not),
that in turn may have another Employee as a department head, then to obtain the name of Bob's department head, if any), we write the following:

``` kotlin
bob?.department?.head?.name
```

Such a chain returns *null*{: .keyword } if any of the properties in it is null.

## Elvis Operator

When we have a nullable reference `r`, we can say "if `r` is not null, use it, otherwise use some non-null value `x`":

``` kotlin
val l: Int = if (b != null) b.length() else -1
```

Along with the complete *if*{: .keyword }-expression, this can be expressed with the Elvis operator, written `?:`:

``` kotlin
val l = b?.length() ?: -1
```

If the expression to the left of `?:` is not null, the elvis operator returns it, otherwise it returns the expression to the right.
Note that the right-hand side expression is evaluated only if the left-hand side is null.

## The `!!` Operator

The third option is for NPE-lovers. We can write `b!!`, and this will return a non-null value of `b`
(e.g., a `String` in our example) or throw an NPE if `b` is null:

``` kotlin
val l = b!!.length()
```

Thus, if you want an NPE, you can have it, but you have to ask for it explicitly, and it does not appear out of the blue.

By the way, `!!` is added for conciseness, and formerly was emulated by an extension function from the standard library, defined as follows:

``` kotlin
inline fun <T : Any> T?.sure(): T =
  if (this == null)
    throw NullPointerException()
  else
    this
```

## Safe Casts

Regular casts may result into a `ClassCastException` if the object is not of the target type.
Another option is to use safe casts that return *null*{: .keyword } if the attempt was not successful:

``` kotlin
val aInt: Int? = a as? Int
```
