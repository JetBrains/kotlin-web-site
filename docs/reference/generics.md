# Generics

As in Java, classes in Kotlin may have type parameters:

``` kotlin
class Box<T>(t: T) {
  var value = t
}
```

In general, to create an instance of such a class, we need to provide the type arguments:

``` kotlin
val box: Box<Int> = Box<Int>(1)
```

But if the parameters may be inferred, e.g. from the constructor arguments or by some other means, one is allowed to omit the type arguments:

``` kotlin
val box = Box(1) // 1 has type Int, so the compiler figures out that we are talking about Box<Int>
```

## Variance

One of the most tricky parts of Java's type system is wildcard types (see [Java Generics FAQ](http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html)).
And Kotlin doesn't have any. Instead, it has two other things: declaration-site variance and type projections.

First, let's think about why Java needs those mysterious wildcards. The problem is explained in [Effective Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/effectivejava-136174.html), Item 28: *Use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility*.
First, generic types in Java are **invariant**, meaning that `List<String>` is **not** a subtype of `List<Object>`. 
Why so? If List was not **invariant**, it would have been no 
better than Java's arrays, cause the following code would have compiled and cause an exception at runtime:

``` java
// Java
List<String> strs = new ArrayList<String>();
List<Object> objs = strs; // !!! The cause of the upcoming problem sits here. Java prohibits this!
objs.add(1); // Here we put an Integer into a list of Strings
String s = strs.get(0); // !!! ClassCastException: Cannot cast Integer to String
```
So, Java prohibits such things in order to guarantee run-time safety. But this has some implications. For example, consider the `addAll()` method from `Collection` 
interface. What's the signature of this method? Intuitively, we'd put it this way:

``` java
// Java
interface Collection<E> ... {
  void addAll(Collection<E> items);
}
```

But then, we would not be able to do the following simple thing (which is perfectly safe):

``` java
// Java
void copyAll(Collection<Object> to, Collection<String> from) {
  to.addAll(from); // !!! Would not compile with the naive declaration of addAll:
                   //       Collection<String> is not a subtype of Collection<Object>
}
```

(In Java, we learned this lesson the hard way, see [Effective Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/effectivejava-136174.html), Item 25: *Prefer lists to arrays*)


That's why the actual signature of `addAll()` is the following:

``` java
// Java
interface Collection<E> ... {
  void addAll(Collection<? extends E> items);
}
```

The **wildcard type argument** `? extends T` indicates that this method accepts a collection of objects of *some subtype of* `T`, not `T` itself. 
This means that we can safely **read** `T`'s from items (elements of this collection are instances of a subclass of T), but **cannot write** to 
it since we do not know what objects comply to that unknown subtype of `T`. 
In return for this limitation, we have the desired behaviour: `Collection<String>` *is* a subtype of `Collection<? extends Object>`. 
In "clever words", the wildcard with an **extends**\-bound (**upper** bound) makes the type **covariant**.

The key to understanding why this trick works is rather simple: if you can only **take** items from a collection, then using a collection of `String`s
and reading `Object`s from it is fine. Conversely, if you can only _put_ items into the collection, it's OK to take a collection of
`Object`s and put `String`s into it: in Java we have `List<? super String>` a **supertype** of `List<Object>`.
 
The latter is called **contravariance**, and you can only call methods that take String as an argument on `List<? super String>` 
(e.g., you can call `add(String)` or `set(int, String)`), while 
if you call something that returns `T` in `List<T>`, you don't get a `String`, but an `Object`.

Joshua Bloch calls those objects you only **read** from **Producers**, and those you only **write** to **Consumers**. He recommends: "*For maximum flexibility, use wildcard types on input parameters that represent producers or consumers*", and proposes the following mnemonic:

*PECS stands for Producer-Extends, Consumer-Super.*

*NOTE*: if you use a producer-object, say, `List<? extends Foo>`, you are not allowed to call `add()` or `set()` on this object, but this does not mean 
that this object is **immutable**: for example, nothing prevents you from calling `clear()` to remove all items from the list, since `clear()` 
does not take any parameters at all. The only thing guaranteed by wildcards (or other types of variance) is **type safety**. Immutability is a completely different story.

### Declaration-site variance

Suppose we have a generic interface `Source<T>` that does not have any methods that take `T` as a parameter, only methods that return `T`:

``` java
// Java
interface Source<T> {
  T nextT();
}
```

Then, it would be perfectly safe to store a reference to an instance of `Source<String>` in a variable of type `Source<Object>` -- there are no consumer-methods to call. But Java does not know this, and still prohibits it:

``` java
// Java
void demo(Source<String> strs) {
  Source<Object> objects = strs; // !!! Not allowed in Java
  // ...
}
```

To fix this, we have to declare objects of type `Source<? extends Object>`, which is sort of meaningless, because we can call all the same methods on such a variable as before, so there's no value added by the more complex type. But the compiler does not know that.

In Kotlin, there is a way to explain this sort of thing to the compiler. This is called **declaration-site variance**: we can annotate the **type parameter** `T` of Source to make sure that it is only **returned** (produced) from members of `Source<T>`, and never consumed. 
To do this we provide the **out** modifier:

``` kotlin
abstract class Source<out T> {
  fun nextT(): T
}

fun demo(strs: Source<String>) {
  val objects: Source<Any> = strs // This is OK, since T is an out-parameter
  // ...
}
```

The general rule is: when a type parameter `T` of a class `C` is declared **out**, it may occur only in **out**\-position in the members of `C`, but in `return C<Base>` can safely be a supertype 
of `C<Derived>`.

In "clever words" they say that the class `C` is **covariant** in the parameter `T`, or that `T` is a **covariant** type parameter. 
You can think of `C` as being a **producer** of `T`'s, and NOT a **consumer** of `T`'s.

The **out** modifier is called a **variance annotation**, and  since it is provided at the type parameter declaration site, we talk about **declaration-site variance**. 
This is in contrast with Java's **use-site variance** where wildcards in the type usages make the types covariant.

In addition to **out**, Kotlin provides a complementary variance annotation: **in**. It makes a type parameter **contravariant**: it can only be consumed and never 
produced. A good example of a contravariant class is `Comparable`:

``` kotlin
abstract class Comparable<in T> {
  fun compareTo(other: T): Int
}

fun demo(x: Comparable<Number>) {
  x.compareTo(1.0) // 1.0 has type Double, which is a subtype of Number
  // Thus, we can assign x to a variable of type Comparable<Double>
  val y: Comparable<Double> = x // OK!
}
```

We believe that the words **in** and **out** are self-explaining (as they were successfully used in C# for quite some time already), 
thus the mnemonic mentioned above is not really needed, and one can rephrase it for a higher purpose:

**[The Existential](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) Transformation: Consumer in, Producer out\!** :-)

## Type projections

### Use-site variance: Type projections

It is very convenient to declare a type parameter T as *out* and have no trouble with subtyping on the use site. Yes, it is, when the class in question **can** actually be restricted to only return `T`'s, but what if it can't? 
A good example of this is Array:

``` kotlin
class Array<T>(val length: Int) {
  fun get(index: Int): T { /* ... */ }
  fun set(index: Int, value: T) { /* ... */ }
}
```

This class cannot be either co\- or contravariant in `T`. And this imposes certain inflexibilities. Consider the following function:

``` kotlin
fun copy(from: Array<Any>, to: Array<Any>) {
  assert(from.length == to.length)
  for (i in from.indices)
    to[i] = from[i]
}
```

This function is supposed to copy items from one array to another. Let's try to apply it in practice:

``` kotlin
val ints: Array<Int> = array(1, 2, 3)
val any = Array<Any>(3)
copy(ints, any) // Error: expects (Array<Any>, Array<Any>)
```

Here we run into the same familiar problem: `Array<T>` is **invariant** in `T`, thus neither of `Array<Int>` and `Array<Any>` 
is a subtype of the other. Why? Again, because copy **might** be doing bad things, i.e. it might attempt to **write**, say, a String to `from`,
and if we actually passed an array of `Int` there, a `ClassCastException` would have been thrown sometime later.

Then, the only thing we want to ensure is that `copy()` does not do any bad things. We want to prohibit it from **writing** to `from`, and we can:

``` kotlin
fun copy(from: Array<out Any>, to: Array<Any>) {
 // ...
}
```

What has happened here is called **type projection**: we said that `from` is not simply an array, but a restricted (**projected**) one: we can only call those methods that return the type parameter 
`T`, in this case it means that we can only call `get()`. This is our approach to **use-site variance**, and corresponds to Java's `Array<? extends Object>`, 
but in a slightly simpler way.

You can project a type with **in** as well:

``` kotlin
fun fill(dest: Array<in String>, value: String) {
  // ...
}
```

`Array<in String>` corresponds to Java's `Array<? super String>`, i.e. you can pass an array of `CharSequence` or an array of `Object` to the `fill()` function.

### Star-projections

Sometimes you want to say that you know nothing about the type argument, but still want to use it in a safe way. 
The safe way here is to say that we are dealing with an *out*\-projection 
(the object does not consume any values of unknown types), and that this projection is with the upper bound of the corresponding parameter, i.e. `out Any?` 
for most cases. Kotlin provides a shorthand syntax for this, that we call a **star-projection**: `Foo<*>` means `Foo<out Bar>` where `Bar`
 is the upper bound for `Foo`'s type parameter.

*Note*: star-projections are very much like Java's raw types, but safe.

# Generic functions

Not only classes can have type parameters. Functions can, too. Usually, we place the type parameters in angle brackets **after** the name of the function:

``` kotlin
fun singletonList<T>(item: T): List<T> {
  // ...
}
```

But for [Extension functions](extensions.html) it may be necessary to declare type parameters before specifying the receiver type, so 
Kotlin allows the alternative syntax:

``` kotlin
fun <T> T.basicToString() : String {
  return typeinfo.typeinfo(this) + "@" + System.identityHashCode(this)
}
```

If type parameters are passed explicitly at the call site, they can be only specified **after** the name of the function:

``` kotlin
val l = singletonList<Int>(1)
```

# Generic constraints

The set of all possible types that can be substituted for a given type parameter may be restricted by **generic constraints**.

## Upper bounds

The most common type of constraint is an **upper bound** that corresponds to Java's *extends* keyword:

``` kotlin
fun sort<T : Comparable<T>>(list: List<T>) {
  // ...
}
```

The type specified after a colon is the **upper bound**: only a subtype of `Comparable<T>` may be substituted for `T`. For example

``` kotlin
sort(list(1, 2, 3)) // OK. Int is a subtype of Comparable<Int>
sort(list(HashMap<Int, String>())) // Error: HashMap<Int, String> is not a subtype of Comparable<HashMap<Int, String>>
```

The default upper bound (if none specified) is `Any?`. Only one upper bound can be specified inside the angle brackets.
If the same type parameter needs more than one upper bound, we need a separate **where**\-clause:

``` kotlin
fun cloneWhenGreater<T : Comparable<T>>(list: List<T>, threshold: T): List<T>
    where T : Cloneable {
  return list when {it > threshold} map {it.clone()}
}
```

## Class objects

Another type of generic constraints are *class object* constraints. They restrict the properties of a [class object](classes.html#class-objects) of the root class of a type being substituted for `T`.

Consider the following example. Suppose, we have a class `Default` that has a property `default` that holds a **default** value to be used for this type:

``` kotlin
abstract class Default<T> {
  val default: T
}
```

For example, the class `Int` could extend `Default` in the following way:

``` kotlin
class Int {
  class object : Default<Int>() {
    override val default = 0
  }
  // ...
}
```

Now, let's consider a function that takes a list of [nullable](null-safety.html) `T`'s, i.e. `T?`, and replaces all the `null`s with the default values:

``` kotlin
fun replaceNullsWithDefaults<T : Any>(list: List<T?>): List<T> {
  return list map {
    if (it == null)
      T.default // Error: For now, we don't know if T's class object has such a property
    else it
  }
}
```

For this function to compile, we need to specify a type constraint that requires a **class object** of `T` to be of a subtype of `Default<T>`:

``` kotlin
fun replaceNullsWithDefaults<T : Any>(list : List<T?>) : List<T>
    where class object T : Default<T> {
// ...
```

Now the compiler knows that `T` (as a *class object* reference) has the `default` property, and we can access it.
