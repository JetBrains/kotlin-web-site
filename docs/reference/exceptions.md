# Exceptions

## Exception Classes

All exception classes in Kotlin are descendants of the class `Exception`.
Every exception has a message, stack trace and an optional cause.

To throw an exception object, use the *throw*{: .keyword }-expression

``` kotlin
throw MyException("Hi There!")
```

To catch an exception, use the *try*{: .keyword }-expression

``` kotlin
try {
  // some code
}
catch (e: SomeException) {
  // handler
}
finally {
  // optional finally block
}
```

There may be zero or more *catch*{: .keyword } blocks. *finally*{: .keyword } blocks may be omitted.
However at least one *catch*{: .keyword } or *finally*{: .keyword } block should be present.

### Try is an expression

*try*{: .keyword } is an expression, i.e. it may have a return value.

``` kotlin
val a: Int? = try { parseInt(input) } catch (e: NumberFormatException) { null }
```

The returned value of a *try*{: .keyword }-expression is either the last expression in the *try*{: .keyword } block or the
last expression in the *catch*{: .keyword } block (or blocks).
Contents of the *finally*{: .keyword } block do not affect the result of the expression.

## Checked Exceptions

Kotlin does not have checked exceptions. There are many reasons for this, but we will provide a simple example.

The following is an example interface of the JDK implemented by `StringBuilder` class

``` java
Appendable append(CharSequence csq) throws IOException;
```

What does this signature say? It says that every time I append a string to something (a `StringBuilder`, some kind of a log, a console, etc.)
I have to catch those `IOExceptions`. Why? Because it might be performing IO (`Writer` also implements `Appendable`)...
So it results into this kind of code all over the place:

``` kotlin
try {
  log.append(message)
}
catch (IOException e) {
  // Must be safe
}
```

And this is no good, see [Effective Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/effectivejava-136174.html), Item 65: *Don't ignore exceptions*.

Bruce Eckel says in [Does Java need Checked Exceptions?](http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions):

> Examination of small programs leads to the conclusion that requiring exception specifications could both enhance developer productivity and enhance code quality, but experience with large software projects suggests a different result â€“ decreased productivity and little or no increase in code quality.
