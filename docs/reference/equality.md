# Equality

In Kotlin there are two types of equality:

* Referential equality (two references point to the same object)
* Structural equality (a check for `equals()`)

## Referential equality

There is no built-in operator to check for referential equality, for we believe that it is rarely needed. Instead,
there's an inline function `identityEquals()` that can be called in the following way

``` kotlin
a.identityEquals(b)
// or
a identityEquals b // infix call
```

And returns true if and only if `a` and `b` point to the same object.

## Structural equality

Structural equality is checked by the `==` operation (and its negated counterpart `!=`). By convention, an expression like `a == b` is translated to

``` kotlin
a?.equals(b) ?: b.identityEquals(null)
```

I.e. if `a` is not `null`, it calls the `equals(Any?)` function, otherwise (i.e. `a` is `null`) it checks that `b` is referentially equal to `null`.

Note that there's no point in optimizing your code when comparing to `null` explicitly: `a == null` will be automatically translated to `a.identityEquals(null)`.
