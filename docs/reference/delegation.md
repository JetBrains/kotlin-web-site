# Delegation

## Class Delegation

The [Delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance,
and Kotlin supports it natively requiring zero boilerplate code.
A class `Derived` can inherit from a trait `Base` and delegate all of its public methods to a specified object:

``` kotlin
trait Base {
  fun print()
}

class BaseImpl(val x: Int): Base {
  override fun print() { print(x) }
}

class Derived(b: Base) : Base by b

fun main() {
  val b = BaseImpl(10)
  Derived(b).print() // prints 10
}
```

The *by*{: .keyword }-clause in the supertype list for `Derived` indicates that `b` will be stored internally in objects of `Derived`
and the compiler will generate all the methods of `Base` that forward to `b`.
