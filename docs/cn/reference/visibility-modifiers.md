# Visibility Modifiers

Classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, functions, properties and their setters can have _visibility modifiers_.
(Getters always have the same visibility as the property.) 
There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: `private`, `protected`, `internal` and `public`.
The default visibility, used if there is no explicit modifier, is `public`.

Below please find explanations of these for different type of declaring scopes.
  
## Packages
  
Functions, properties and classes, objects and interfaces can be declared on the "top-level", i.e. directly inside a package:
  
``` kotlin
// file name: example.kt
package foo

fun baz() {}
class Bar {}
```

* If you do not specify any visibility modifier, `public` is used by default, which means that your declarations will be
visible everywhere;
* If you mark a declaration `private`, it will only be visible inside the file containing the declaration;
* If you mark it `internal`, it is visible everywhere in the same module;
* `protected` is not available for top-level declarations.

Examples:

``` kotlin
// file name: example.kt
package foo

private fun foo() {} // visible inside example.kt

public var bar: Int = 5 // property is visible everywhere
    private set         // setter is visible only in example.kt
    
internal val baz = 6    // visible inside the same module
```

## Classes and Interfaces

When declared inside a class:

* `private` means visible inside this class only (including all its members);
* `protected` --- same as `private` + visible in subclasses too;
* `internal` --- any client *inside this module* who sees the declaring class sees its `internal` members;
* `public` --- any client who sees the declaring class sees its `public` members.

*NOTE* for Java users: outer class does not see private members of its inner classes in Kotlin.
 
Examples:

``` kotlin
open class Outer {
    private val a = 1
    protected val b = 2
    internal val c = 3
    val d = 4  // public by default
    
    protected class Nested {
        public val e: Int = 5
    }
}

class Subclass : Outer() {
    // a is not visible
    // b, c and d are visible
    // Nested and e are visible
}

class Unrelated(o: Outer) {
    // o.a, o.b are not visible
    // o.c and o.d are visible (same module)
    // Outer.Nested is not visible, and Nested::e is not visible either 
}
```

### Constructors

To specify a visibility of the primary constructor of a class, use the following syntax (note that you need to add an
explicit *constructor*{: .keyword } keyword):

``` kotlin
class C private constructor(a: Int) { ... }
```

Here the constructor is private. By default, all constructors are `public`, which effectively
amounts to them being visible everywhere where the class is visible (i.e. a constructor of an `internal` class is only 
visible within the same module).
     
### Local declarations
     
Local variables, functions and classes can not have visibility modifiers.


## Modules

The `internal` visibility modifier means that the member is visible with the same module. More specifically,
a module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together:

  * an IntelliJ IDEA module;
  * a Maven or Gradle project;
  * a set of files compiled with one invocation of the <kotlinc> Ant task.
