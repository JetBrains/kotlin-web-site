# Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas

## Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that takes functions as parameters, or returns a function.
A good example of such a function is `lock()` that takes a lock object and a function, acquires the lock, runs the function and releases the lock:

``` kotlin
fun lock<T>(lock: Lock, body: () -> T): T {
  lock.lock()
  try {
    return body()
  }
  finally {
    lock.unlock()
  }
}
```

Let's examine the code above: `body` has a [function type](#function-types): `() -> T`,
so it's supposed to be a function that takes no parameters and returns a value of type `T`.
It is invoked inside the *try*{: .keyword }-block, while protected by the `lock`, and its result is returned by the `lock()` function.

If we want to call `lock()`, we can pass another function to it as an argument (see [function references](reflection.html#function-references)):

``` kotlin
fun toBeSynchronized() = sharedResource.operation()

val result = lock(lock, ::toBeSynchronized)
```

Another, often more convenient way is to pass a [function literal](#function-literals-and-function-expressions) (often referred to as _lambda expression_):

``` kotlin
val result = lock(lock, { sharedResource.operation() })
```

Function literals are described in more [detail below](#function-literals-and-function-expressions), but for purposes of continuing this section, let's see a brief overview:

* A function literal is always surrounded by curly braces,
* Its parameters (if any) are declared before `->` (parameter types may be omitted),
* The body goes after `->` (when present).

In Kotlin, there is a convention that if the last parameter to a function is a function, then we can omit the parentheses

``` kotlin
lock (lock) {
  sharedResource.operation()
}
```

Another example of a higher-order function would be `map()`:

``` kotlin
fun <T, R> List<T>.map(transform: (T) -> R): List<R> {
  val result = arrayListOf<R>()
  for (item in this)
    result.add(transform(item))
  return result
}
```

This function can be called as follows:

``` kotlin
val doubled = ints.map { it -> it * 2 }
```

One other helpful convention is that if a function literal has only one parameter,
its declaration may be omitted (along with the `->`), and its name will be `it`:

``` kotlin
ints.map { it * 2 }
```

These conventions allow to write [LINQ-style](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx) code:

``` kotlin
strings.filter { it.length == 5 }.sortBy { it }.map { it.toUpperCase() }
```

## Inline Functions

Sometimes it is beneficial to enhance performance of higher-order functions using [inline functions](inline-functions.html).

## Function Literals and Function Expressions

A function literal or a function expression is an "anonymous function", i.e. a function that is not declared,
but passed immediately as an expression. Consider the following example:

``` kotlin
max(strings, { a, b -> a.length() < b.length() })
```

Function `max` is a higher-order function, i.e. it takes a function value as the second argument.
This second argument is an expression that is itself a function, i.e. a function literal. As a function, it is equivalent to

``` kotlin
fun compare(a: String, b: String): Boolean = a.length() < b.length()
```

### Function Types

For a function to accept another function as a parameter, we have to specify a function type for that parameter.
For example the abovementioned function `max` is defined as follows:

``` kotlin
fun max<T>(collection: Collection<out T>, less: (T, T) -> Boolean): T? {
  var max: T? = null
  for (it in collection)
    if (max == null || less(max!!, it))
      max = it
  return max
}
```

The parameter `less` is of type `(T, T) -> Boolean`, i.e. a function that takes two parameters of type `T` and returns a `Boolean`:
true if the first one is smaller than the second one.

In the body, line 4, `less` is used as a function: it is called by passing two arguments of type `T`.

A function type is written as above, or may have named parameters, for documentation purposes and
to enable calls with [named arguments](functions.html#named-arguments).

``` kotlin
val compare: (x: T, y: T) -> Int = ...
```

### Function Literal Syntax

The full syntactic form of function literals, i.e. literals of function types, is as follows:

``` kotlin
val sum = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }
```

A function literal is always surrounded by curly braces,
parameter declarations in the full syntactic form go inside parentheses and have optional type annotations,
the body goes after an `->` sign.
If we leave all the optional annotations out, what's left looks like this:

``` kotlin
val sum: (Int, Int) -> Int = { x, y -> x + y }
```

It's very common that a function literal has only one parameter.
If Kotlin can figure the signature out itself, it allows us not to declare the only parameter, and will implicitly
declare it for us under the name `it`:

``` kotlin
ints.filter { it > 0 } // this literal is of type '(it: Int) -> Boolean'
```

Note that if a function takes another function as the last parameter, the function literal argument can be passed
outside the parenthesized argument list.
See the grammar for [callSuffix](grammar.html#call-suffix).

### Function Expressions

One thing missing from the function literal syntax presented above is the ability to specify the return type of the
function. In most cases, this is unnecessary because the return type can be inferred automatically. However, if you
do need to specify it explicitly, you can use an alternative syntax: a _function expression_.

``` kotlin
fun(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
```

A function expression looks very much like a regular function declaration, except that its name is omitted. Its body
can be either an expression (as shown above) or a block:

``` kotlin
fun(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
  return x + y
}
```

The parameters and the return type are specified in the same way as for regular functions, except that the parameter
types can be omitted if they can be inferred from context:

``` kotlin
ints.filter(fun(item) = item > 0)
```

The return type inference for function expressions works just like for normal functions: the return type is inferred
automatically for function expressions with an expression body and has to be specified explicitly (or is assumed to be
`Unit`) for function expressions with a block body.

Note that function expression parameters are always passed inside the parentheses. The shorthand syntax allowing
to leave the function outside the parentheses works only for function literals.

One other difference between function literals and function expressions is the behavior of
[non-local returns](inline-functions.html#non-local-returns). A *return*{: .keyword }  statement without a label
always returns from the function declared with the *fun*{: .keyword } keyword. This means that a *return*{: .keyword }
inside a function literal will return from the enclosing function, whereas a *return*{: .keyword } inside
a function expression will return from the function expression itself.

### Closures

A function literal or expression (as well as a [local function](functions.html#local-functions) and an [object expression](object-declarations.html#object-expressions))
can access its _closure_, i.e. the variables declared in the outer scope. Unlike Java, the variables captured in the closure can be modified:

``` kotlin
var sum = 0
ints.filter { it > 0 }.forEach {
  sum += it
}
print(sum)
```

### Extension Function Expressions

In addition to ordinary functions, Kotlin supports extension functions.
This kind of functions is so useful that extension function literals and expressions are also supported.
One of the most important examples of their usage is [Type-safe Groovy-style builders](type-safe-builders.html).

An extension function expression differs from an ordinary one in that it has a receiver type specification.

``` kotlin
val sum = fun Int.(other: Int): Int = this + other
```

Receiver type may be specified explicitly only in function expressions, not in function literals. Function literals
can be used as extension function expressions, but only when the receiver type can be inferred from the context.

The type of an extension function expression is a function type with receiver:

``` kotlin
sum : Int.(other: Int) -> Int
```

The function can be called with a dot or in infix form (since it has only one parameter):

``` kotlin
1.sum(2)
1 sum 2
```
